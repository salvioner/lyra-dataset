Watch that spider in the bathroom sink
He&sup1;s a better friend than you might think
So let him spin his web in peace
He catches creepy crawly things

I never fall asleep at night
I never get the chance
My thoughts won't stop spinning round
They dance and dance and dance

Watch each hair on your head turn gray
Look out the window and count your days
One two four five six seven eight
There ain't much to love and there's plenty to hate

I never fall asleep at night
I never get the chance
My thoughts won't stop spinning round
They dance and dance and dance

Look at that bone-yard over there
You can see it out the window from the kitchen chair
I wanna see my name carved in one of them stones
I wanna be part of them rottin' bones

I never fall asleep at night
I never get the chance
My thoughts won't stop spinning round
They dance and dance and dance
