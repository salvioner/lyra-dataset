"The Warning"


Dear god, I'm gonna teach you in this prayer
And I thank you for all the food you've given me
And all the health and strength
And may my family be held safely and strong
As well as myself
And I thank you for everything you've given me thus far, lord
And I beg your forgivness
For I sin everyday
In your sons name, Christ Jesus
Amen


They all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz they all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz this world wants me...Dead or alive


Nigga look at what the streets have done to me man
Hustlin and strugglin
I deserve a better hand
Cuz I'm runnin these streets under they say
Motherfuckers like you can't relate
Cuz you ain't all about the hustling all about the bustin
All about the thuggin, baby
Never let it go
If you gotta die, lie, shake it wit a fo'-fo'
Then do so, cuz that's the life you chose
Shoul've fallowed the cracks in the road
You heart and your soul
Cuz if there's one thing I know
Good niggaz come and they go
Bitch niggaz actin like ho's, merely needed to get treated like one
Hope you got yourself a gun niggaz
Cuz you know I cock and blow niggaz
And if right silent the temp, get on some shit
Go on out, six feet deep and slump niggaz
Cuz I'm a survivor like Destiny's Children
To the day of my demise
I'ma ask the lord why


They all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz they all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz this world wants me...Dead or alive


Take a look at what this worlds done made me
All I really want to do is be happy, and raise my family
But I'm strong, motherfuckers can't break me down
Niggaz really gonna hate me now
As I'm givin a fuck
I'm tryna get my life together
Shit a nigga can't ride forever
Tryna see a hundred mil' or better
Befo' I die
Don't ask me why, I
Got a fasination wit for freak ho's
New whips wit two seats and two do's
I've been waitin so long to explode
Now watch me cock back and unload
Bullets goin threw the chest and out the back
Shit is usually how the babry acts
Now the look in your face is so relaxed
Now your family moans and deals wit that
But me, I'm a survivor like Destiny's Children
Til the day of my demise
I'm gonna ask the lord why


They all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz they all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz this world wants me...Dead or alive


They all want me...Dead
Why the fuck would they want to see me live?
So I'm gearin up to get into some shit
Niggaz better kiss the wife and kids
It's just the way us niggaz live
And I run wit real niggaz that run wit big guns

Never met a real nigga I didn't like
Never met a bitch nigga that I didn't fight
Now niggaz gon get down, and a nigga gon lay down
Dependin on how niggaz view life
And you'll never look in my eyes
And you'll never, ever smile
Cuz your high, is comin down
And you can't touch me
But if you really wanna fuck wit me
C'mon and get your heat my niggaz
Don't you ever prevoke my niggaz
Don't ever doubt this nigga
Cuz I'm a survivor like Destiny's Child
Til the day of my demise
I'm gonna ask the lord why


They all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz they all want me dead or alive
But they'll never take me alive
I'll get even before I die
Cuz this world wants me...Dead or alive
