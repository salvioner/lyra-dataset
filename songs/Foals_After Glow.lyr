I know I could not last very long at all
Without you here to break my fall
I know I could not stand alone for very long
Without you there to take my coat
'Cause you were better than whatever came before
Before you ran out and left me on the 100th floor

Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out, don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow

No, I could not do the things I did before
Leave you waiting there by that open door
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here and my heart broken to the core

Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out, don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow

No, I could not stand to be alone for long
There's something missing in the ever after glow
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here to save me, to save me from the dark

Get out, and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out, don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow
