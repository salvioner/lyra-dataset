I know a place where you can go
When you're flyin high or layin low
And I've got the time
I've got plenty to spare
I've got the time, and I've got the place
I just wish you were there



Whether you're up, or whether you're down
And I know the way

I've got the will, and I've got the way
I just wish you were there
