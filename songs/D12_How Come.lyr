So I changed huh? You got a phone
pick it up, call me

How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

We were so young 
So full of life and vibrance 
side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side 
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
and a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it. 
You even had the same type of childhood I did.. 
sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it 
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us.. 
and I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it. you're cold
your touch is just like ice. 
And your eyes is a look of resentment.
I can sense it and I dont like it.

How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!



It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse 
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse
fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
for I let him disrespect me, or check me over some 
worthless bitch that I wasnt with
I woulda hit it and quit
but you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you dont get involved with her
you would smoke in the car with her
coming outta the bar with her
stumbling half drunk
like you were husband and wife or somethin
but me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
cause you were openin your mouth to people like you wanted with me.
when all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
you acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose.
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.
Dont hate the game or the player
the one thats changing is you.



How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!



Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
now we acting like I gotta live only for the block.
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
like my finger get to snappin
and poof it just happen. 
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown, 
shady made it so my babies aint starving at home. 
See the devil in your glance, 
since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence, 
thats forever till the end. 
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies, 
aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise. 


And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away, 
we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face.



How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!
