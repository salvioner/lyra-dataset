Yeah, haha, you feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too, damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together.
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with the *rchick-rchick-chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again

Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise

There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please

Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady

I told you I'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

*Chicka-chicka*
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh

Dynamite, ohh ohh
So

*Chicka-chicka*
I can hold you in the mornin'
But in the evenin' I gotta go
*Chicka-chicka*
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh

I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweatin'
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya

Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feelin' of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie

I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded, you couldn't pick <a href="/wiki/Amy_Winehouse" title="Amy Winehouse">Amy Winehouse</a> out of a lineup

So stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get the Pineapple Schnapps goin', no one will knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Sayin' don't disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

*Chicka-chicka*
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So
*Chicka-chicka*
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh
*Chicka-chicka*
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So

*Chicka-chicka*
I can hold you in the mornin'
But in the evenin' I gotta go
*Chicka-chicka*
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
