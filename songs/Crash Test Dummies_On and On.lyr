Come with me down this ol' road
Where I got stuck and later towed
Listen to the sound of the falling rain
We just might end up stuck again

The little bird can sing and sing
The little bird knows everything
But the little bird don't bother with song
He knows that it just goes on and on and on and on

Climb up in this tree with me
The branches are big and there's plenty to see
Listen to the sound of the blowin' leaves
Feel that breeze goin' through your sleeves

The little bird can sing and sing
The little bird knows everything
But the little bird don't bother with song
He knows that it just goes on and on and on and on

Don't go followin' me no more
I'm sick of your face at my back door
Don't you listen to the bird in your head
Just remember what I said

The little bird can sing and sing
The little bird knows everything
But the little bird don't bother with song
He knows that it just goes on and on and on and on and on

Come with me down this ol' road
Where I got stuck and later towed
Listen to the sound of the falling rain
We just might end up stuck again...
