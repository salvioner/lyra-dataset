Ah, ha
Oh, yeah


Somebody told me
Boy, everything she wants
Is everything she sees
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me
Baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want
And everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me
Oh


Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la)

Somebody tell me
Oh

Why I work so hard for you

Work to give you money)
Oh

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give-and-take
Well, you've shown me you can take
You've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two


Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo)
I can't work any harder than I do

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la)

Somebody tell me
Oh

Why I work so hard for you

Oh

To give you money
Oh

Oh
Why do I do the things I do
Tell you if I knew
My god
I don't even think that I love you



Give you money
Work to give you money)
Oh

Oh, yeah
Tell me
Tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time
My situation never changes
Walking in and out of that door
Like a stranger for the wages
I give you all
You say you want more

And all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time


Work, work
La, la, la, la, la)
Just a matter of

Work
Oh
Work
Oh
Ah ha, ah ha
Work
Doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la)

Somebody tell me
Oh

Somebody
Why I work so hard for you

Oh, to give you money


Somebody tell me
Oh

Why I work so hard for you

Oh, to give you money


Oh

Somebody tell me

Oh, please tell me
Why
I do the things that I do

Work to give you money).
