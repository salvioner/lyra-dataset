I once knew a sweet young girl
Her body was her world and love
Her laughter was as happiness is
Of all the times I treasure this
And on a day we will remember
On a clear day we will love forever

I once knew a sweet young dream
That if life itself were all we had
And who are we to ask for more
Let's not be sad, let's be sure
And on a day we will remember
On a clear day we'll all be together, together
