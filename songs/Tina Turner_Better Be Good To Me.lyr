Prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell


Oh, yes, I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion?
Should I?
Should I?

Oh, you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Yeah, better be good

C'mon, c'mon
Be good to me

I think it's also right 
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case

Yes, I know
You keep telling me that you love me
And I really do wanna believe
But did you think I'd just accept you 
In blind faith?
Oh, sure, babe
Anything to please you

But you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over-loaded lines
But you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good, good to me

Be good to me

And I really don't see 
Why it's so hard to be 
Good to me

And you know, I don't understand
What's your plan 
That you can't be good to me?

What I can't feel
I surely cannot see
Why can't you be good to me?

If it's not real
I do not wish to see
Why don't you be good to me?

Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Be good

Be good to me

'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines

So you better be good to me!
Yeah, you better be good
Better be good to me
Better be good


'Cause I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines
And I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth

And you better be good to me

Be good to me

Be good

Be good to me


'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines

You better be good to me

Good to me

Better be 

Good to me

Be good

Be good to me

Good to me

Why can't you be 

Good to me? 

Why can't you be 

Good to me? 

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Be good to me
