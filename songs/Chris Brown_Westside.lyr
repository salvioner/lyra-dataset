That body looking yummy, yeah, that ass talkin'
Sexy her swag awesome, Jimmy Shoes, bag, flossin'
Up in the club stuntin' sipping that Nuvo
Lemon head, Look at my chains shinin' like chandeliers
Where my pretty girls at, sexy face, ass fat
Hotel poppin' after hours I'mma smash that!
Call me daddy, fat stacks, pockets on swoll, nothin' less than hundred on the Kush when I smoke

Looking for a red bone, big booty head strong
Hopin' I can take her home satisfaction guaranteed
Dr. feel good, got yo baby momma calling me
I be workin' in them sheets, $80 due, heavy plumbin'
All night, long bang, bang, like a lone drummer
We rush bottles to that VIP, C.D.E
We in the buildin' ladies go crazy, A.D.D
That's what we do , so what it do, baby what it's lookin' like?
Love my liquor brown, mix it with a little Sprite, that's gon' get me right looking for my friend tonight
Sweet tooth,performin' the placard pieces, my appetite. She like entertain us, so she gonna entertain us, dip it low, stripper pose dollars at her ankles
Everything is paid for, put that on my tab, I put that on me and I got it on smash

Baby girl I put you up right we headin' to the West Side
