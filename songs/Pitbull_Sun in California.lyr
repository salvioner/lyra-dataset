<b>Pitbull</b>
Catch me on the getaway like OJ on the highway, all white bronco
Catch me on the way to check out my dog
Mohombi all the way, all the way out in Congo
Catch me with a couple beautiful women that's ready for a combo, let's hit the condo
Welcome to the new age hotel, California
Nice to meet you, Armando

<b>Mohombi</b>
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you

<b>Pitbull</b>
Beats taking over the world
Y'all better get used to the fact
I jump on the track, drop the bass
And I ain't talkin' 'bout crack

I was born in a era
Where Michael Jackson was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
And when it came to drugs
Miami would always stand and deliver

Welcome to the 80s
Ladies and gentlemen
I took over the radio, I took over the clubs
Late night, no Letterman

My father, he was never there
But it made me a better man
The party's the world, the world's my girl
I dare you not to let 'em in

<b>Mohombi</b>
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you

Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you

You're like the sun in California
Where there is no you there's no euphoria
