Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world
Like it's someplace that you've been

You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
Cause you're livin' in a world that
You're best forgotten, around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

You see you'd love to run home
But you know ain't got one
Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
Ain't nobody gonna listen
To the one small point
I know they've been missin' round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You see you'd love to run home
But you know ain't got one
Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
Ain't nobody gonna listen
To the one small point
I know they've been missin' round here
Round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die
