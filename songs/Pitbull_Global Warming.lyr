Up in this a new million
You heard me, Sensato
It's Mr. Worldwide
Y El mundo helpatio
Let my dreams yall dormant
Category 6's are stormin
Take this as a, take this as a warning
Welcome to, welcome to global warming

I'm tired of this rap shit 'cause all they do is rap shit
About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit
But they never sold coke crack or click clack shit
That's why I'm laughing to the bang, ha-ha bitch
Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit
Without Denver, I'm going to November
Earth, wind, fire, I'm all for September
George Lopez puto, you remember
Now I'm stalked by bankers and lenders
Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas Splenda
I see your game, your plan, your agenda
They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo
No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
I do it for the paper, I'm a business man
If you get it that's cool
It's all about the billionaires baby, welcome to the new school

Al banco voy a abrirle una cuenta
Pa' meterle miles miles y matarile
I get's money, en mi bloque hay misiles
Hay que comprarle chemises y zapatos bien reptiles
It's all about them billionaires
I'm so fucking serious
Look, I love them zeros, they looking like Cheerios
Monty like her period, y'all niggas gotta hurry up
My team is in your area, regando la epidemia
Tengo una novia Albania, blanquita macademia
Estoy enfermo de leucemia
Yall bronkers got anemia
So if you get it that's cool
It's all about them billionaires baby,
Welcome to the new school
