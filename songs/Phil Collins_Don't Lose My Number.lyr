They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
And nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
"I'm never coming back", I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Searchin' through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop until they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand, they never asked him why
"Get out of my way", I heard a shout, then a blinding light
All I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Now don't give up, oh Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, 'cause you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy
You'd better, you'd better, you'd better run for your life

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cos you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cos you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
I'm never coming back, I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh Billy
