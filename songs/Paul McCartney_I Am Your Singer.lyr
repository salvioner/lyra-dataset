You are my love, you are my song, liger on, 
You are my song, I am your singer. 
You are my one, you are my own melody, 
You are my song, I am your singer. 

Someday when we're singing 
We will fly away, going winging. 

Sing, singing my love song to you. 

My song is sung, 
when day is done harmonies willinger on, 
I am your singer, 
I am your singer, 
Singing my love song to you.
