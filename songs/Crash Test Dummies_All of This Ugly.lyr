I was walking through the country
And passing through lovely scenery
When I came upon some rotting remains
And though the carcass was wormy
Well, after all, it's all part of nature's art of cleaning

And if I try hard I think that I will see
Some good behind all of this ugly

When my job was garbageman
I'd go out and empty the garbage cans
And I'd come upon some rotting remains
But we'd drive them outside town
And fill the land, and make hills that you could walk around on

And if I try hard I think that I will see
Some good behind all of this ugly

If I were born as a vulture
I'd fly out and circle high in the air
And I'd look out for rotting remains
And if they weren't quite dead yet
A little bite would help things so I could get started

And if I try hard I think that I will see
Some good behind all of this ugly
