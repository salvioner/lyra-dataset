A desert road from Vegas to nowhere 
Some place better than where you've been 
A coffee machine that needs a little fixing

I am calling you 
Can't you hear me 
I am calling you 
A hot dry wind blows right through me 
The baby's crying and I can't sleep 
But we both know a change is coming 
Coming closer, sweet release 
I am calling you 
I know you hear me 
I am calling you Oh 
I am calling you 
I know you hear me 
I am calling you
