Uncanny woman
You weaved your spell on me
I was taken by the look in your eyes 
For all the wrong reasons
You must have been a spiteful child
Full of anger
Raised by the hand of a dutchess, a mother and a heathen

You laid your tender trap of crystal and wine
Your neck was sweet enlaced with a scent I did not mind

I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
Angel don't cry...
Angel don't cry...

Queen of darkness
You got your way with me

You caressed every part of me soul
You got what you were after
A savage and an angel
You innocently hunger for love
I'm still shivering from the coldness of your laughter

You laid your tender trap of crystal and wine
Your neck was sweet enlaced with a scent I did not mind

I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
Angel don't cry...
Angel don't cry...
No, angel don't cry...
Angel don't cry
No, no, no

You laid your tender trap of crystal and wine
Your neck was sweet enlaced with a scent I did not mind

I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
I can't lie
Angel don't cry...
No, angel don't cry...
Oh, angel don't cry...
No, no, no
Angel don't you cry
