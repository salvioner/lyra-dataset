Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

<i>(I knew I loved you before I met you)</i> Ooh
<i>(I knew I loved you)</i>
<i>(I knew I loved you before I met you)</i> Ooh
<i>(I knew I loved you)</i>
<i>(I knew I loved you before I met you)</i>
<i>(I knew I loved you)</i> Oh
<i>(I knew I loved you before I met you)</i>
<i>(I knew I loved you)</i>
