Midnight on a southern highway
Don't know if I'm going the right way
I haven't seen a single sign for miles
All this stormy weather
Keeping us from being together
How long has it been since I've seen your smile
In this tunnel called the night
I can finally see a light
I've got a burning deep inside
I thought you might understand
I'm driving fast as I can
And you said you'd wait for me

Goin' Home
'Cause I've been away much too long
Goin' Home
Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home
Going back where I left my family
Goin' Home
And I hope that they're still waiting there for me

In the eyes of the legal tender
You're the one who must surrender
I think they call it responsibility
I'm a man in motion
With only one compulsion
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart
I'm not looking for a fight
No one's wrong and no one's right
And maybe we all need time apart
So please understand 

I'm doing the best that I can
And you said you'd wait for me

Goin' Home
'Cause I've been away much too long
Goin' Home
Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home
Going back where I left my sanity
Goin' Home
And I hope that it's still waiting there for me

I though you might understand
I'm doing the best that I can
And you said you'd wait for me

Goin' Home
'Cause I've been away much too long
Goin' Home
Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home
Going back where I left my family
Goin' Home
And I hope that they're still waiting there for me

Goin' Home
