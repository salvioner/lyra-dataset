When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don't ya feel like cryin', don't ya feel like cryin'
Well, here I am honey, c'mon, you cry to me

When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
Don't ya feel like cryin', don't ya feel like cryin'
Don't ya feel like cryin', c'mon, c'mon, you cry to me

Nothin' can be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, such a waste of time, oh yeah
You don't ever have to walk alone, oh you see, oh c'mon
Take my hand, baby won't ya walk with me? Oh yeah

When you're waitin' for a voice to come
In the night but there is no one
Don't ya feel like cryin'

Don't ya feel like cryin'


Don't ya feel like cry-cry-cryin'

Don't ya feel like cry-cry-cryin'
