I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before

But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mmm-mmm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk

And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
