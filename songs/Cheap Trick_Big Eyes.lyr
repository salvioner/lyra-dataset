It's not the way you look, no.
It's not the way you walk.
Your eyes are so very good.
You know they're clear and bright,
It's not the color of your hair.

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those big eyes.
They keep calling my name, big eyes.
I keep fallin' for those big eyes.
They keep calling my name.

You're such a losing cause.
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause,
Go on and get out of here.

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those big eyes.
They keep calling my name.

You're such a losing cause.
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause,
Go on and get out of here.

It's not the way you look, no.
It's not the way you walk.
Your eyes are so very good.
You know they're clear and bright,
It's not the color of your hair.

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those big eyes.


They keep calling my name.


Big eyes, I keep falling for those big eyes.
They keep calling my name.
Big eyes, I keep falling for those big eyes.
I keep calling your name.

Big Eyes.
