Graveyard people with graveyard minds
Peeking out through half-drawn blinds
Desperate people with desperate minds
Only live amongst straight lines
Scorning the gypsies camped out in the fields
What do they know of the warrior's shield?

Go-slow workers with Union minds
Striking out for better times
Sunshine people with sunshine minds
Living in these troubled times
Follow shop stewards like so many sheep
Sowing the seed that our children will reap

Go-slow workers with Union minds
Striking out for better times
Sunshine people with sunshine minds
Living in these troubled times
Get it together, no one knows how we feel
Sowing the seed that our children will reap
