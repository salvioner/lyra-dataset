All ready to get on my way, move on up into the city today, I can see you've got a solar report, keeps you in and keeps you boring I can hear you snoring. one of these days, you'll hear the sound
Speed, I'll come crashin' in your flat and, say hey it's too late. all your friends are drivin' round,
Coming up to feel the weekend goin' up in smoke,
Kiss behind the coolest of walls,
Standing there to tear your heart out,
Oh no you've got a blow out.
One of these days you'll feel the sound of speed
I'll come crashin' in your flat
And say hey come on now.
I can go for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
All dressed up to get on my way,
Move on up into the city today,

I can see you've got a solar report,
You're still in and you're still boring
I can hear you snoring.
One of these days,
You'll feel the sound of speed,
I'll come crashin' in your flat and,
Say hey come on now.
I can go for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
See me I can feel it coming around.
Yeah
Yeah
