Girl I don't understand, stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't wanna see, wanna see you leave
Wanna let you go, I just wanna find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologised tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go


And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go


Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at a dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go


And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go


Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with
I never thought I'd been the one to say goodbye
I'm sick and tried of the arguing and I don't wanna do it again
Again, woo
