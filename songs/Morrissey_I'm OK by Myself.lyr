Could this be an arm around my waist?
Well, surely the hand contains a knife?
It's been so all of my life
Why change now?
"It hasn't!"
Now this might surprise you, but
I find I'm ok by myself
And i don't need you
Or your morality to save me
No, no, no, no, no
Then came an arm around my shoulder
Well surely the hand holds a revolver?
It's been so all of my life
Why change now?
"It hasn't!"
Now this might disturb you, but
I find I'm ok by myself
And I don't need you
Or your benevolence to make sense
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
After all these years I find I'm ok by myself
And I don't need you
Or your homespun philosophy
No, no, no, no
This might make you throw up in your bed:
I'm ok by myself!
And I don't need you
And I never have, I never have
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
ooooooo!
