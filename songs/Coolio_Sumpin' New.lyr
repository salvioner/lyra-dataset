{'album': u"Gangsta's Paradise", 'generi': [], 'titolo': u"Sumpin' New", 'artista': u'Coolio'}

This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business,
And people come from miles around
With an almost religious devotion
To get on down.

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

What up everybody so glad you're here 
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear 
This ain't a fantastic voyage but I'm still on a mission 
To see if I can get your attention 
Now I wants to drop some information 
Just a little additive to your education 
I live my life by the code of the funk 
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk 
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so 
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C 
Double O, L, I, O with the flow 
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know 
1, 2, 3, it's like A-B-C 
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free 
Slide, slide, but that's the past 
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass 

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

If you got beef, then nigga eat a porkchop 
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop 
I brake like antilocks, panties drop, 
From hood to hood, block to block 
Help, I need somebody 
To get it goin' on in this party 
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right, 
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night 
My name ain't Wonder, but I'll rock your world 
Get more bounce than a Jheri curl 
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues 
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so 
Grab your partner, do-si-do, 
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio, 
Slide, slide, but that's the past, 
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass 

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on no toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to get 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy,
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give a nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean 
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open 
Slide, slide, but that's the past 
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass.

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor

Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
