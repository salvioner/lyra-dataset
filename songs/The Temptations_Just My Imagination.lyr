Mm, hmm, mm
Ooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me



A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Telling you it was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I would surely die

Mm, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

Just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Oh, tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her, but I can't forget her

Just my imagination, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Running away with me
Ooh, just my imagination
Running away with me
