Well, East Coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The Midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel all right
And the Northern girls, with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian island dolls
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States
Back to the cutest girls in the world

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

I wish they all could be California

I wish they all could be California

I wish they all could be California

I wish they all could be California


I wish they all could be California

I wish they all could be California

I wish they all could be California
