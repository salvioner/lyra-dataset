It's hanging above you and it's over
It's over your head
Hovering slowly I hear words
Too and I totally agree
It ain't just you and me

Since then you've been looking at me
Like I been on your mind
Everything would have been
Don't take it like we're taking it home

It's over your head
It's over my head
