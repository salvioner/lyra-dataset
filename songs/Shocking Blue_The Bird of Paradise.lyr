One fine day I had a long distance call
I called my guy he's waiting far away
He said hello and I got that feeling
The bird of paradise flew upon my nose
The bird of paradise flew upon my nose

His voice was low and I heard him say
Come little baby come silly soul
You gotta know I need you so badly
And the bird of paradise flew upon my nose.
