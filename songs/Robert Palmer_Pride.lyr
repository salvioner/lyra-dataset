You want her attention 
Well you'll have to wait 
She's in the gymnasium 
Reducing weight 

In shorts of a leotard 
Despite her age 
The girl's gonna exercise 
Your life away 

Sister don't you jog it all away 
Sister don't you run it all off 
Sister don't you jog it all away 
Sister don't you rough it all up 

What an idea of fun 
To get it on the run 
I don't know why you do 
What has come over you? 

The style in the discotheque 
Is cheap and nice 
Please tell Ms Fonda 
To reduce her price 

Anorexia nervosa mannequin 
All this physicality 
Will wear you thin 

Hey Olivia Newton-John 
What you say? 
Hey Olivia Newton-John 
What you say? 

She used to yield like flesh 
Now it's all muscle 
She used to yield like flesh 
Now it's all muscle 

I don't know why you do 
What has come over you 
What an idea of fun 
To get it on the run 

Rollerskates and vitamins and diet plans 
Academic discipline will ruin your hands 
We used to ride tandem and have lots of fun 
But bicycles for exercise are made for one
