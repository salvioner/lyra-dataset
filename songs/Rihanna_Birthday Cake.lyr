Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it

Bet you wanna put your name on it
Your name on it, b-b-b-uh

It's not even my birthday
But he wanna lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow my candles out
He want that

Cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake


Ooh baby I like it

Don't try to hide it
Imma make you my bitch

Cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake


I know you wanna bite this
It's so enticing
Nothing else like this
Imma make you my bitch

And it's not even my birthday
Bet you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday
And he try'na put his name on it

I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body
I'd do anything
