Love, like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand

Darling, I
Put my heart up on the shelf
Till the moment was right
And I told myself

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Oh now
As I look into your eyes
Well, I wonder if it's wise
To hold you like I've wanted to before

Tonight
Ooh, I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life
In this heart of mine

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Next time I fall in love
Oh, oh, oh
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you
