Morning opens quietly
A shadow vision over me
I know you well
Hidden by the windowpane
And all my sadness gone charade
Begins to fade, how long it stayed

Patterns of another day
Awaken slowly out of grey
A tolling bell
Rolling down the alleyway
It's calling all my dreams away
My dreams are songs I play
