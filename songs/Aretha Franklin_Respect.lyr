I ain't gonna do you wrong
While you're gone
Ain't gonna do you wrong









I'm about to give you
All of my money
And all I'm askin'
In return, honey
Is to give me my propers
When you get home






Ooh, your kisses











R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care, T-C-B, oh
