Far, we've been travelin in fog
Without a home, But not without a star
Free, only want to be free
We huddle close, hang on to a dream

On the boats and on the planes, they're coming to America
Never looking back again, they're coming to America

Home...though it seems so far away
We're traveling light today,
In the eye of the storm...in the eye of the storm
Home...to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burnng warm, freedom's light burning warm

Everywhere around the world, they're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled, they're coming to America
Got a dream to take them there, they're coming to America
Got a dream they come to share, they're coming to America

They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
