The Last Temptation, we comin' through now niggaz


Turn me up this bitch up in my mothafuckin' headphones and shit

Let it known...muh'afuckas y'all want war wit' the GOD
C'mon y'all know better, I put holes in ya leather
Re-knit your sweater, and I bet the flows wet her
Then notion front property - better come at me properly
Niggaz better off poppin' me - but I believe
Y'all scared ta clap from henis
In the fact I'm unpredictable, gives me the advantage
What the fuck, am I'm speaking spanish niggaz
What I got ta tell y'all in detail how we murder niggaz
Handle ya buisness, Tha Inc. is religious
Murders a sacrifice, throwing ends niggaz
That means Murda fa' life, and I'll die for that bread and black
That house wit' tha chedda stack, wit' smiles in my kids face
What could replace this, this lil' nigga here 
The coming grimce wit' death, ta taste it 
My airs thick and filled wit' hatred
Surprise of that look in my eyes, but don't be
I'm just following the foots of the Lord, then thank me
If I go crazily insane, I'ma blame it on the world
Look what I became, 'cause they ain't give me all the fame 
and the money mayne, maybe an I-con
So the world can catch a nigga wit' his lights on
That's the pros and con, ya never quite free
So just gimme a lil' room so I can breathe
And my pain goin' be the death of me
But to be loved is my destiny, My black peep...
