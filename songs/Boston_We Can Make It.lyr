I would do anything, anything a man can do
You're my strength and weakness
I give it all for you
I would climb any mountain
How can I make you see?
Though the stars may fall, it will always be you and me

The light in your eyes is all the hope I need
There's so much you can give
Your smile is my reason to live

Just take my hand, we'll make a stand
I know that we can make it

I know that we can make it, you and me

I see you, full of sadness
Wondering 'bout this world we've made
There's a space between us all
Love has seen some better days

Oh we can make it
Oh we can make it

The love in your eyes is all I need to know
I'm never letting go
I'm here for you heart and soul

Just take my hand, we'll make a stand
I know that we can make it

I know that we can make it


Just take my hand, we'll make a stand
I know that we can make it

I know that we can make it
I know that we can make it
You and me
