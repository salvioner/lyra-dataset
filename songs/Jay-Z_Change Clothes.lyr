Uh, uh, whooo, the bounce is back
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, your boy is back

Y'Need the bounce for the sexy you know
Let's get it in...


Yeah ma, your dude is back, 
The Maybach roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
New York, New York! yeah where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that 
I been through that, 
been shot at shoot back
Gotta keep it peace like a buddhist
I ain't a New Jack nobody 'gon Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe Jedi knight
The more space I get the better I write

I need the space to say whatever I like, now just







And I 'gon tell you again let's get ghost in the Phantom
You could bring your friend we could make this a tandem
You could come by yourself and you could stand him
Best believe I sweat out weaves, 
Give afropuffs like R.A.G.E.
"Haa-u-git"* if you could move it
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi now shit
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
He is to the east coast what Snoop is, 
to the west coast what Face is to Houston

Now why you frontin on me? is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game
Whose up on Dot Dot Dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane? let's just









Young Hovi in the house it's so necessary

Let's go to my hotel cause this don't go well
With those S Dots, try to stay fresh ma
Ma, I don't shop where the rest buy
Oh no ma please respect ma
Jiggy this is probably Purple Label
Or that BBC or it's probably tailored
But y'all niggas actin way to tough
Throw on a suit get it tapered up, and let's just
