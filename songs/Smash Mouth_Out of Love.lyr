And don't ask, I wanna say yes to you
But I think I'm through, I ain't lying
Don't ask, I wanna stay next to you
Never wanted to, see you crying
I want whiff your life
Go on, it's gonna be alright

See I've hit and I missed
Can you read this lives
My pushes finally come to show
'Cause I've lived and I've learned
And I've crashed and I've burned
And I think I finally had enough
Yeah, I think I'm simply our of love

It's okay, I know you're gonna find the one
You gonna meet someone who make it better
But tonight I gotta let it go
But when you trill you know it last forever
The one and the strong
And I swear it's not leavin' to one

See I've hit and I missed
Can you read this lives
My pushes finally come to show
'cause I've lived and I've learned
And I've crashed and I've burned
And I think I finally had enough
Yeah, I think I'm simply our of love

I've been down every road,
Always live the simplest when the story it's own
I'ma feel like..
The one it is it could be
The last thing for me
I've lived and I've learned
And I've crashed and I've burned
And I think I finally had enough

See I've hit and I missed
Can you read this lives
My pushes finally come to show
'Cause I've lived and I've learned
And I've crashed and I've burned
And I think I finally had enough
Yeah, I think I'm simply our of love

Uh la la, uh la la la
Uh la la, uh la la
