You are
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen
you shine
Just like sunlight rays on a winter snow

I just had to tell you so

Your eyes
Sparkle as the stars, like the moon the glow
Your smile
Could light the world on fire or did you know?
Your mind's
Full of everything that I want to know

I just had to let you know
I just had to tell you so

You're my butterfly, high
Fly high
fly, fly, fly
