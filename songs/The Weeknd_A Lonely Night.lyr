Gangster, yeah, yeah
Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us
There's nothin' between us
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us
To keep us together

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night
It was the only time
And if I led you on then I apologize

How can I make you rethink your decision?
Unruly decision
Hey, what's gonna make you rethink your position?
I know your intentions

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time
And if I led you on then I apologize

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night
It was the only time
And if I led you on then I apologize
A lonely night
Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night
It was the only time
And if I led you on then I apologize

Baby girl I loved you
Know I loved you
Know I loved you
Baby
