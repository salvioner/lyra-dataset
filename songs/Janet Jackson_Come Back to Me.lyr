Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago
All my life I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind I've hated
Not able to let go
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long
My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back
To me
Come back
I want you to
Come back
To me
Come back
Please come back to me
I miss you so much
wherever you are
I love you
All my life I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind I hated
Not able to let go 

Not able to let go

Oh no, I won't let you go

You know there's a saying
No, no, no, no
