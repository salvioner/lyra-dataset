Ehhhh, zhe, zhe, zhe, zhe

I was four, four years old
When the Marine left Haiti, the U.S. Marine left Haiti
I was a kid and every time a Marine battalion passed in front of the house
My father took my hand and said,
"Don't look at that, don't look at that."

And every May 18, which is the flag day, the father came
Put the Haitian flag in front of the house
And I said, "Father, what is that, what does that mean for you?"
And he said,"That means that you are Haitian.

Never forget that.
You are Haitian. You are from this land.
You are not French, you are not British, you are not American
You are Haitian."
