You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That is only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

<i>(What's love)</i> got to do
Got to do do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

<i>(What's love got to do)</i>
Ooh, got to do do with it?
<i>(What's love but a sweet second-hand emotion?)</i>
What's love got to do got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
