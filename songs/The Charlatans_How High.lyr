How high
Oh! I can kiss the sun
Run a minute mile
While you hitch hike
Love shines a light
I'll be a winners cup
And I'm lookin' for the one who cut you up
You're not having me
You know the skies are mean
And I'm hopin' for a way to free you

Love I'm fixing holes
The ones you break up
Come in from your drive
And the hand that rocks you
Cuts you up like
Lyrics of your life

I can't buy
What I've done before
I want to open up another door
I'm going to let you pass
I'm on another path
I want to be the king
While you zig zag
On a holy road
Like Caine from Kung Fu
How high oh! I can kiss the sun

Hang on to your hopes my darlin'
Don't let it slip away
And the hand that holds you
Keeps you warm
And helps you live today

Love shines a light
And it takes and it hurts
I know I'm right
I can bend till I burst
And love shines a light
And repays you with us
Yeah too right
I'm gonna pledge my time till the day I die

How high
Oh! I can kiss the sun
Run a minute mile while you hitch hike
Love shines a light
I'll be a lovin' cup
I'll be down when you're down
I'll be up when you're up
You're not havin'
I know the skies are mean
And I'll be looking for a way to free you love

I'm fixing holes
The ones you break up
Comin' from your drive
And the hand that rocks you
Cuts you up like
Lyrics of your life

Love shines a light
And it takes and it hurts
I know I'm right
I can bend till I burst
And love shines a light
And repays you with us
Yeah too right
I'm gonna pledge my time till the day I die
