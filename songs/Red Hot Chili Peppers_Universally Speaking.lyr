I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired

Bloodshot, your smile 
Delicate and wild 
Give me she-wolf style 
Rip right through me 

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind 
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine 
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow 

Come on baby, 'cause there's no name for 
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking 
I take it back and you make me nervous 
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run 

I saw your crime 
Dying to get high 
Two of a kind 
Beats all hands tonight 

Silvretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind 
Nothing better the feeling is so fine 
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow 

Come on baby, 'cause there's no name for 
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking 
I take it back and you make me nervous 
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

Silvretta, the jets of a lifetime 
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind 
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine 
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Let's go
