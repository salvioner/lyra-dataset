I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
But now we've realized
Love's not all that it's s'posed to be
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day

I know we really tried
Together we had love inside
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh

After what you meant to me
Ooh, baby, now I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that we both agree
Best thing to happen to you, the best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

<i>We love you
We love you
Let's spend the night together
We love you
Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas, gas, gas</i>

Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day
