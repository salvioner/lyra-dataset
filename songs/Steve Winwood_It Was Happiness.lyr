We had the stars-they kept shining
Where they led us we followed
Two for love-wandering
I look back-here's what I see
We were outside-there was Paris-it was raining
And we felt everything
In a crowded street in london-happiness
And we were so alive
And your soul was a wide and deep blue sea
I would drown, and you'd rescue me
And we lived our life like a story
Clear to the ending

It was happiness-so clear-happiness
Happiness-no tears-happiness

Can't keep time from its running
Soon the best times are over
Photographs-hold me
And I see how good we were
There was that day out in Carmel, California
With no clothes in the sun
In a crowded street in London-happiness
And then it all goes by
So I drink to the past and what still will be

One day I'll be a memory
But I lived my life like a story
Too bad there's an ending
