Momma!
Rockin' on the roulette wheel
Momma grabbed my hand
She was about to die
And she said, "Child, I never been around you much
But I want to give you one thing
Oh, your father was a one-eyed jack of hearts
With diamonds and an ace up his sleeve
Let me tell you I got the system
I got the plan, I got the plan."
Momma give me your blessing
So I can be stronger
Queen of Las Vegas
Queen of Las Vegas
Don't leave me
Queen of Las Vegas
Queen of Las Vegas

Come here again
MY momma she grabbed my hand
She looked at me with a bittersweet smile
She said..."Throw 'em a mile!"
Oh! Momma! I got the system!
Oh, oh, oh Momma, I understand the plan
Give me your blessing so I can be stronger
Help me to grow up and be the Queen

Queen of Las Vegas, Queen of Las Vegas

Queen of Las Vegas, Queen of Las Vegas
Queen of Las Vegas
