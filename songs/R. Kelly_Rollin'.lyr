Kellz
I'm back Niggas

Ya'll thought I was gone?
Nope

Rollin


Rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin

And now I'm rollin all you bitches wanna hop in 
Rollin



I'm going toot toot, beep beep
Pulling up on them wheels now
All black on body got it shining much like a seal now
And a shoty much like a seal now
Got them cars in my garage
No less than a mil now
Kellz about to take the bar
And I'mma set it real high
Double take, double take
When I roll up to the club
Players hate, players hate
When I walk up in the club
I got them shades on doing about 75
Just call me speed racer cause I'm rollin in at mach 5
Ya'll niggas aint f**king with me
And I put a mil on it
Niggas and bitches they lie
But home boy them stats don't
R & B Boss
Hussling like Rick Ross
Man my flow is so raw,
So niggas don't piss me off
I'm a player homie and that's a well known factor
Plus the wheels on that coup got it looking like a tractor


Take my ice hold it up
Then my city toss it up
Chi town, summer time
Kellz got traffic backed up

Rollin


Rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin

And now I'm rollin all you bitches wanna hop in 
Rollin




Yellow ice
Cash money, I got cash money
Just to hear them horses go 
Vrrrrrmmmm
I spent that cash money
As for the haters, they ass funny
My money like a road block
So watch how you roll roll your crash dummy
I'm rolling in, I roll and bounce, I roll and stop
Roll slow motion, then I let the beat drop
Honies love it when I roll up on them wheels
Top down, looking fly, 
Climbing on them wheels
I got them 24's on that coup
You know they chop and spin
I put an S on my maybach cause that's my super benz
I own a nightlight shining when I roll through
Hop out that Zerogi 101 color Smurf blue
Silver bullet Lex Jeap parked out at my beach home
Think I'm from the swamp the way I step out with them gators on
On the hood on that old school, I be smoking trees on it
Just copped a Cadillac, I'm about to throw some D's on it

Rollin


Rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin
I'll be rollin

And now I'm rollin all you bitches wanna hop in 
Rollin
