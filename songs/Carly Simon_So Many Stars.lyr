The dawn is filled with dreams, 
So many dreams. 
Which one is mine? 
One must be right for me. 
Which dream of all the dreams, 
When there's a dream for every star? 
And there are oh, so many stars! 
So many stars! 
The wind  is filled with songs, 
So many songs. 
Which one is mine? 
One must be right for me. 
Which song of all the songs, 
When there's a song for every star? 
And there are oh, so many stars! 
So many stars! 
Alone the countless days, 
The endless nights 
That I have searched; 
So many eyes, so many hearts, so many smiles! 
Which one to choose? 
Which way to go? 
How can I tell? 
How will I know? 
Out of oh, so many stars, 
So many stars!
