Can't tell me nothin' now baby I know how to fly
Can't nothin' hold me down
I'm gon' to touch the sky

Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down, down
Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down, down
Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down
Now watch me, now watch me, now watch me shut this thing down

Sube sube, hasta las nubes,

I hit the jackpot jack,
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ching
Real peoples do real things on the road to get diamond rings
Moved up from the streets
Graduated hustla on it's way to a entrepreneur undefeated, Douglass Busta'

Now baby save me
From the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch... now fuck you, pay me

Sube sube, hasta las nubes,
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non è stata scritta

Can't tell me nothin' now
Baby I know how to fly
Can't nothin' hold me down
I'm gon' touch the sky

Lose my money, honey 
Now pay me whats you owe me
Mami's a hurricane you should see the way she blow me
I don't make it rain, I spit that global warmin'
This ain't no Biggie, ready to die, number five, there is no warnin'

Now baby, save me from the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch... now fuck you, pay me

Sube sube, hasta las nubes,
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non è stata scritta

Can't nothin' hold me down
I'm gon' touch the sky
Can't tell me nothin' now
Baby, I know how to fly
Can't nothin' hold me down
I'm gon' touch the sky

Can't nothin' nothin'
Hold me down, down
Can't nothin' nothin'
Hold me down, down
Can't nothin' nothin'
Hold me down,
Now watch me, now watch me, now watch me shut this thing down

It's my life
Imma do what I do
And if you don't like it, it's cool,
Fuck you
