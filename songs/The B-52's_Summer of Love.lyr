Summer of love
Summer of love

I've been waiting for the man
Just buzzing around
Downtown
Waiting for that very special
Comes in to see what I got
Orange Popsicles and lemonade

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love
For everyone transcends here
I'm thinking of you, boy
Love energy is giving us a shove
Making this the summer of love

I said
I see no clouds ahead

Summer of love
Summer of love

I'm standing in the rain
Just feeling the nitty-gritty of the
Whole thing
Everything is very special
Look in and see what I got
Orange Popsicles and lemonade

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love
For everyone transcends here
I'm thinking of you, boy
Love energy is giving us a shove
Making this the summer of love

Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of love

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love

It's the summer of love, love, love
I'm in love with love, love, love

For everyone
For everyone
For everyone
For everyone).
