Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Uh huh, let's rave

<b>Katy Perry</b>
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully

'Cause I
I'm capable of anything
Of anything
And everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

<i>(Hey)</i> Are you ready for, ready for
<i>(Hey)</i> A perfect storm, perfect storm
<i>(Hey, hey)</i> 'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
<i>(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)</i> There's no going back

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage

But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

<i>(Hey)</i> Are you ready for, ready for
<i>(Hey)</i> A perfect storm, perfect storm
<i>(Hey, hey)</i> 'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
<i>(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)</i> There's no going back

<b>Juicy J</b>
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She'll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But li'l mama's so dope
I messed around and got addicted
