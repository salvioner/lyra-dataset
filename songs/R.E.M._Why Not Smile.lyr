The concrete broke your fall
To hear you speak of it
I'd have done anything
I would do anything

I feel like a cartoon brick wall
To hear you speak of it
You've been so sad
It makes me worry

Why not smile?
You've been sad for a while
Why not smile?

I would do anything
To hear you speak of it
Why not smile?
You've been sad for a while
You've been sad for a while
