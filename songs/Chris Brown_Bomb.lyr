We should go back to my crib, thats what I'ma tell her
Bring one or two of them, cause your friends looking kinda jealous
Rolling papers like propellors blowing mozarella
Lotta n-ggas in the club, who cares I'm the realest
Tell the waiters we gon need more cases

And when you think the money's gone we spending more faces
She with homeboy, but she want this
6 cars, 8 chains, 3 cribs, 1 Wiz


She thick in her hips, Cold than a mother
Licking her lips, a bad mothersucker
Apple looking so right, she make me want a piece
I give it to her all night, so she don't wanna leave

And theres so much ice up on my neck it look like I play hockey
So hold up n-gga, stop me
All these haters watch me

Any stage or any beat you know I'ma body
And Wiz roll that good shit up and he riding shotty

She thick in her hips, Cold than a mother
Licking her lips, a bad mothersucker
Apple looking so right, she make me want a piece
I give it to her all night, so she don't wanna leave
