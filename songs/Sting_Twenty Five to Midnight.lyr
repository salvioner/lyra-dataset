Train I ride, don't be slow
If your whistle can blow
Fifteen miles down the track
Tell them I'm coming back
Counting poles, counting sheep
Don't be slow, I won't weep
If your wheels on the line
Were to put me on time

Just a year to the day
Since I went upon my way
To seek my fortune and fame
Be a star, change my name

And that's it more or less
Till this midnight express
I know I can't be late
'Cause she said she won't wait
She'll just go marry Jack
So there's no turning back
And it's twenty-five to midnight
And fifteen miles of track

Band I had got a break
Just one chance we had to take
Told my girl I'd be back
Left her with my friend Jack
New York City for a spell
Things didn't turn out so well
Every dive that we played
We were lucky we got paid
Mister train driver please
If your speed you increase
Every cent I have now
Will be yours this I vow

And that's it more or less
Till this midnight express
I know I can't be late
'Cause she said she won't wait
She'll just go marry Jack
So there's no turning back
And it's twenty-five to midnight
And fifteen miles of track

We called ourselves the Latino Lovers
Hawaiian shirts and top-forty covers
I didn't think I could sink this low
When drugs and booze ate all my dough
This isn't how it was meant to be
There's no such thing as a meal that's free
If I was ever to get out alive
I have to get home on time

Train I ride don't be slow
If your whistle can blow
Fifteen miles down the track
Tell them I'm coming back

And that's it more or less
Till this midnight express
I know I can't be late
'Cause she said she won't wait
She'll just go marry Jack
So there's no turning back
And it's twenty-five to midnight
And fifteen miles of track

And it's twenty-five to midnight
And fifteen miles of track
