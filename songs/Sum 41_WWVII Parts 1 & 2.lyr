Yeah!


The year is 3468
And they're about to eliminate
Life as we all know it on Planet Earth
They're products of a new regime
With manufactured designer genes
Scientifically enhanced at birth

Superior in almost every way
With telepathic DNA
They'll hunt you down there's nowhere you can hide
Created for the killing machine
Proto-nuclear human beings
We must help to prevent this genocide

Have we created, our own demise
Their out to kill, using their minds
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime?
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up

It seems the time has come for the human race
Gone for good, vanishing without a trace
Cerebroids are silencing their cries
The clones are trying to assist evolution
Through state sponsored executions
Will nothing stop this evil enterprise?

Until the day a leader emerges
With mind powers like electric surges
He'll give us hope, he'll teach us how to fight
A clash of arms with the enemy
And outcome no can forsee
Let's pray they can't withstand our human right

Have we created, our own demise
Their out to kill, using their minds
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime?
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up

Have we created, our own demise
Their out to kill, using their minds
You'll feel the chill, run down your spine
Tell me, since when has being human been a crime?
Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up
