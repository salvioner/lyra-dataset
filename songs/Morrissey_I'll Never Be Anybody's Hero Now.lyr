Warm lights from the grand houses blind me
Haves cannot stand Have-nots
And my love is under the ground
My one true love is under the ground
And I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
They who should love me
Walk right through me
I am a ghost
And as far as I know I haven't even died
And my love is under the ground
My one true love is under the ground
And I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now



I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's lover now
I'll never be
I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's lover now
Things I've heard and I've seen
And I've felt and I've been
Tell me I'll never be anybody's lover now
It begins in the heart
And it hurts when it's true
It only hurts because it's true
