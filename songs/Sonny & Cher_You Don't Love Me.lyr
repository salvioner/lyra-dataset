Uh uh uh
You don't love me
Yes I know
Uh-uh-uh
You don't love me

Well you left me pretty baby
And I had no place to go
Yes I love you
I'll do anything you say
Yes I love you
I'll do anything you say
If you say you love me baby
I'll get on my knees and pray 

Uh uh uh
You don't love me
Yes I know
Uh-uh-uh
You don't love me
Yes I know 

Uh uh uh
You don't love me
