"Happiness is" 



Look at a clown 
He paints a smile on everybody's face
Watch the balloon you buy just to let fly away
Though it's funny to see
Still I know that for me

Happiness is to see the love shine in your eyes
Happiness is the way you make me laugh inside

Go to the beach
Build castles of sand that the tide will wash away
Hot dogs & sun, mustard all over your face
Though it's funny to do still I know that my truth

Happiness is to see the love shine in your eyes
Happiness is the way you make me laugh inside

-Instrumental-

Though it's funny to see
Still I know that for me

Happiness is
