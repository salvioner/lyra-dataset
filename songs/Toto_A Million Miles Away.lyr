I don't want to know the reason why you don't love me
I don't want to know the reason why you don't care
I don't want to know the reason why you're leavin' me
I'm not the only one that lost my love way down there - way down there

I don't want to hear the reason why you don't need me
I don't want to hear the reason why you don't stay
I don't want to hear the reason why you're seeing him
All I know is that I want you back, but you're

A million miles away and it's killin' me inside
There's a stranger in a carriage and he's takin' her out tonight
The devil's ridin' on a full moon and he sends his love
When I'm a million miles away

I don't want to be the reason why you don't love me
And I don't want to be the reason why you don't care
I don't want to be the reason why you're leavin' me
I'm not the only one that lost my love

A million miles away and it's killin' me inside
There's a stranger in a carriage and he's takin' her out tonight
The devil's ridin' on a full moon and he sends his love
When I'm a million miles away

He sends his love and I'm a hundred million miles away
