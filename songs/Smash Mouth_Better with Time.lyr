Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

It's like tryin' to make somebody love you back
When they're so over that
And you know that they know it
No use in trying not to face the facts
It's a heart attack
And you don't wanna blow it but

Some things are better off in bed
Some dreams are better left for dead
Sometimes I have to shut my mouth

Ain't no how
Sun just ain't gonna shine
I know now,
Not gonna change your mind
Done is done,
I should've seen the signs
I'm out of your head,
It ain't gonna get
Better with time,
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Better with time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

Sometimes you wake up in the morning light
Wanna make it right,
Just resuscitate it
You think tomorrow's gonna do the trick
What's broken you can fix
Cause you know how to play it but

Some things are better off in bed
Some dreams are better left for dead
Sometimes I have to shut my mouth

Ain't no how
Sun just ain't gonna shine
I know now,
Not gonna change your mind
Done is done,
I should've seen the signs
I'm out of your head,
It ain't gonna get
Better with time,
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Better with time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

I never fit in from the start,
You said you knew you'd break my heart
But I wouldn't listen
Now I'm standing in the rain
Like a picture in a frame
And you're the one who's missing

Ain't no how
Sun just ain't gonna shine
I know now,
Not gonna change your mind
Done is done,
I should've seen the signs
I'm out of your head,
It ain't gonna get

Ain't no how
Sun just ain't gonna shine
I know now,
Not gonna change your mind
Done is done,
I should've seen the signs
I'm out of your head,
It ain't gonna get
Better with time,
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Better with time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
