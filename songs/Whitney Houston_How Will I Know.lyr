There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Hoo, how will I know? <i>(Don't trust your feelings)</i>
How will I know?
How will I know? <i>(Love can be deceiving)</i>
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy <i>(Can't speak)</i>
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me! I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uhh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me, how will I know? <i>(Don't trust your feelings)</i>
How will I know?
How will I know? <i>(Love can be deceiving)</i>
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy <i>(Can't speak)</i>
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me, if he loves me not, mm
If he loves me, ooh, if he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me, if he loves me not

Oh, how will I know?
Ooh, how will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy <i>(Can't speak)</i>
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? <i>(How will I know?)</i>
How will I know?
How will I know? <i>(I say a prayer)</i>
How will I know?

Hoo, how will I know? <i>(I fall in love)</i>
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know? <i>(I'm asking you)</i>
How will I, how will I...
