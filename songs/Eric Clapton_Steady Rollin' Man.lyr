I am a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day.
I am a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day.
But I ain't got no sweet woman, woo-hoo Lord, to be rollin' this way. 

I am the man that rolls when icicles are hanging on the tree.
I am the man that rolls when icicles are hanging on the tree.
Why can't you hear me begging mama, woo-hoo Lord, down on my bended knee?
