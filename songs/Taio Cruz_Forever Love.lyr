Should we say go?
Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now


Because I swore I would


Love you


Should we say go?

Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now


Because I swore I would


Love
