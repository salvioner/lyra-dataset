Hit 'Em! 

Hocus, focus on the mighty mic loco 
Me and the Forty dump yo ass like a pogo 
You better kick it cause I been workin' on my mojo 
Make your crew disapeer like Dorothy and Toto 
Your trippin on me because your girl want my photo 
Nigga, you better chill before I send my homie home with your hoe 
Fools get ca-reemed when they steps into my dojo 
It's the ghetto witch doctor sprinklin herbs on the voco' 
I deliver hits like my name was FujiMoto 
Platinum and gold all the way to Acalpuco 
To all rappers international, domestic, and loc-al 
Step to the fo or get your ass rolled up like a Rollo 
Your points need bifocals 
You better try to see like Total 
My name ain't Ralph Lauren but I'll play your ass like polo 
I kick a solo 
From here to Sojo 
You ain't no man eater, nigga, so your hoe style is no go 













I'm stickin niggaz like Mexican's in penitentaries 
The niggaz is flinchin, see everytime the homies mention me 
Grew up off Avalon and Century 
With a hundred ways of illegal en-ta-ry 
Can't injure me 
My momma fucked the Unibomber that's why I'm blowin shit to smithareens 


The illest things I bring that not even DeVante could swing 
Before a nigga serve me, his seventy-six is a winter green 



I smoke all label rosters when I rock like the thing 
In the bucket doin ninety-five like Rodney King 
Extreme antimostity, your ultimate adversary 

I'll beat that ass blindfolded like a pinata, scary, 
My prom night I was fuckin Carrie, 
Had her screamin "Bloody Mary!" 











Cool, break this nigga off! 

Alright, wait, wait, wait 
It ain't ova 
I burn like a nova 
It's the ?all see Mona? 
Like mother fuckin Yoda 
I rock like baking soda 
From Compton to Dakota 
And when I drop I'm gonna crush all these busta's like a boulda 

I put bitches and pets on a fantastic voyage on a ship like Noah 
I told ya 
I'm a soldier 
Wake that ass up like Folger's 
Give the people what they want a little bit more-a 
You don't know the score 
What the hell you comin here for? 
Whip that ass like grandpa used to do when he was sore 
It's the hardcore 
Take your whole hood to war 
It's time for all the bitch ass niggaz to hit the door 
Go home and get your pen and brush up on your metaphors 
It's the forty muskateer, cuttin that ass up with swords 
You be the prey, I'll be the predator 
Bring the feather to that ass so niggaz call me Thor 








Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em 
Rrrr, stick 'em.  Hit 'em!  Hit 'em!
