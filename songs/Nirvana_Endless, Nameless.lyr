Silence, here I am
Here I am, silent
Bright and clear, it's what I am
I have died

Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother

Death with violence
Excitement right here
Died, go to hell
Here I am right here

No mas
No mas
No mas
No mas

Death is what I am
Go to hell, go to jail
In back of that crime
Here I am, take a chance

Dead!
Die!
