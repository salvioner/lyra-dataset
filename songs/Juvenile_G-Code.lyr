Lil Wayne:
I ain't terrified from nuthin'
I'm young wild crazy and disgustin'
Better watch me cuz I'm coming 
With a oven by my stomach
I'm scramblin' for the money
Tape ya up like a mummy
Call ya people and tell 'em
I need 50 for this dummy
I'm runnin' hidin' and duckin'
Stuntin' ridin' and thuggin
Dumpin' fire and bustin'
Lovin, lyin' and lustin'
Stealin' killin' and rapin
Runnin' climbin and chasin
Strugglin hustin' to make
Get it got it I take it
Watch ya Chevy mister
Move ya purse miss
Cuz I tote heavy pistols
And man they burst quick
It's too late to hesitate
I was told there'd be better days
But shit that was yesterday
And still I haven't ate
But dog that's how ya labor when ya bein' a thug
These niggas don't seem to feel me till they seein' they blood
Can't hide it though
I represent the 17th Carrollton Hollygrove
That's my G-code


Now put ya box in the mud
Get ya glocks in ya gloves
Ride drops on dubs
We gon' live by that
Make the snitches catch a cut
Soldier pistol nigga what
Hit the block and open up
We gon' die by that


Juvenile:
We raised up lookin' at trees and brick walls
Foreign properties and pack some menthals
Got us a fire connect and went off
Got jammed with this broad that rent cars
Wasn't tryin' to change the game, just be in it
Didn't give a fuck if we balled for 3 minutes
Snatch all the hoes and 'bauds and ree' tennis
Niggas can't survive the shit that we been in
Jack niggas to get some cheap linen
The ones that refuse we put 'em to sleep in it
Got up in the mornin' for class and play hookie
Some of us is veteran some of 'em stay rookie
Bitch couldn't talk to us if she wasn't fuckin'
Ya either be bout it or look and keep truckin
Police drew causes and tried to cross lines
We stuck to the code we lived and died by it

Chorus

Juvenile:
If war ever came we held the fort down
Back, slowed up, we switched and sold pound
Stayed on point to make some more green
Get our stash away from dope fiends
Nigga had a habit he supplied his own
Always stay hot cuz we ride with chrome
We kept a little work for the ki's and bones
Crowds draw heat so we be's alone
We learned how to keep our mouth closed and watch
Them other motherfuckers fall off the block
24/7 all around the clock
We hustlin of course in the gamblin spot
We had a chance to stop, we still wasn't ready
Shit kept comin' so we made more fetti
Police drew causes and tried to cross lines
We stuck to the code we lived and died by it

Chorus x 2
