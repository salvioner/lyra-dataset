You love another man
My heart is broken in two
She wears a ring on the other hand
She's scared to tell me the truth, but

If you are leaving
I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more
Way more
So this is the end of us now
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And it ends cause you don't love me
No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

Now that you are comfortable
I think that I am losing my mind
It's crazy cause we were so inseperable
Guess things change with time
Do he kiss and wipe away your tears?
Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear?
If I had a wishing well
I would have you right here, so girl

If you are leaving
Baby I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more
Way more
So if this is the end of us now
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And it ends cause you don't love me
No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

I didn't listen
You been missing
He has your heart now
I'm missing your kisses 
Want it again
Don't leave me down
Wish I could keep you, all to myself
I wanna work it out
But you moved on, I see it now
Oh, guess I'll see you around
