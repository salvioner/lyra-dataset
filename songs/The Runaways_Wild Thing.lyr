Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything
Come on, wild thing

Wild thing, I think you move me
But I gotta know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
Oh you move me

Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything
Come on, wild thing

Wild thing, I think I need you
But I gotta know for sure
Come on and squeeze me tight
Oh I need it

Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything
Come on, wild thing
