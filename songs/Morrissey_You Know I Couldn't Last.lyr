The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you

The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you

So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between your eyes
CDs and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home

The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn and kill you

The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn and kill you

So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between your eyes
CDs and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home

There's a cash register ringing and
It weighs so heavy on my back
Someone please take me home

The critics who
Can't break you
They somehow help to make you

The critics who
Can't break you
Unwittingly they make you

So don't let the good days
Of the gold discs
Creep up and mug you
With evil legal eagles
You know I couldn't last
Accountants rampant
You know I couldn't last
Every -ist and every -ism
Thrown my way to stay

And the Northern leeches go on
Removing, removing, removing

Then in the end
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Oh but
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
