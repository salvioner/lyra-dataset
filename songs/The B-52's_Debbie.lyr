Radio operator to the tower
Debbie's comin' in for a landing
Oh put your head between your knees
Caused by the vibrations of love
They're about to shake me to pieces

Shell-shocked supersonic blonde
Hyperphonic female
Dark sunglasses on
Everyone is here to see
Her all-girl rock band

Vortex pulls me in
The vortex spits me out
Jet-eyed glitter child strappin' on a gold guitar
We witness the ultrasonic imploding exitation
Bodies exhausted in total elation

Shell-shocked supersonic blonde
Hyperphonic female
Dark sunglasses on
Everyone is here to see
Her all-girl rock band

Oh Debbie
Queen of the underground
Carrying her gold guitar
The show is over
My downtown baby is headin' home
Singing a song
She's walkin' alone
She walking down the block
Now she's comin' my way
As our hearts and our dark sunglasses lock

Shell-shocked supersonic blonde
Hyperphonic female
Dark sunglasses on
Everyone is here to see
Her all-girl rock band

Every day-every day
Just a little bit wilder
Every day-every day
Just a little bit tighter
Every day-every day
Just a little bit wilder
Every day-every day
Just a little bit tighter
