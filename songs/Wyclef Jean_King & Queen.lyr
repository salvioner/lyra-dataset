I'm ready, I'm ready
Check, 'Clef, to, rock

Hey, I'm dancin with this girl, you find your own girl
<i>(Oh-own girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl)</i>
It's still no fightin' tonight though homey, yeah
Geyeah, it's all love tonight

My love good for all season, winter summer fall spring
I got de shaman ram flow, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Columbian swing when Shaki do her t'ing
One bright feed the power like Lords of the Ring

Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King
I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream

If you have no home, I'll be your shelter
Baby, don't be scared
If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
Lead you in the spotlight

If you've enough time, I will be one time
Only to be with you tonight
But there is never, never enough time
To make it forever mine

Time after time, you get better like fine wine
I look into your eyes and see your soul in the skyline
Call me Mr. Freeze, I feel a chill in my spineline
'Cause every time you touch me, it's like a divine sign

Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King
I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream

If you have no home, I'll be your shelter <i>(yeah)</i>
Baby, don't be scared
If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
Lead you in the spotlight

If you've enough time, I will be one time <i>(yeah)</i>
Only to be with you tonight
But there is never, never enough time <i>(yes)</i>
To make it forever mine

And I don't wanna put out this fire
Transition like a knight, mama
I feel my place where the soul get higher
Nights get cold I gotta hold ya

Nights that we slept in the middle of the sofa
Holes in our loafer, but we had each other
Christmas throw Santa down the chimney
Felt like Pookie from New Jack when he got the turkey

'Cause we those ReFugees, survive the tsunami
So ain't nobody gonna tell me this ain't what I need

If you have no home, I'll be your shelter <i>(yeah)</i>
Baby, don't be scared
If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes <i>(yeah)</i>
Lead you in the spotlight

If you've enough time, I will be one time <i>(yeah)</i>
Only to be with you tonight
But there is never, never enough time <i>(yes)</i>
To make it forever mine

Shaki', 'Clef
Jerry Wonder what we tell 'em boy
<i>(Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl)</i>
Yo Cliff, let the horns go
<i>(Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl)</i>
