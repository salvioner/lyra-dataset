Aww here it goes

Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room

'Cause they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan

But you gotta watch Keenan 'cause
Keenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top

But they kinda in the middle
'Cause they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity

Like Siegfried and Roy, Stan and Costella
Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble

Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick
