<i>Pitbull</i>:

Next thing you know, she's on top of the bar 


Funny thing is, she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale

<i>Havana Brown</i>:
I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Going nowhere, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god, that was so much fun
Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night

<i>Pitbull</i>:
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened
Never happened

Last night we were off the chain
You name it, we did it
You loved it fo'sho
I cant remember her name, but her ass--That I remember fo'sho!
Convenient amnesia 
Remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget that ass

One life, two worlds-- English, Spanish 
One night, two girls-- English, Spanish 
She's telling me to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale

<i>Havana Brown</i>:
I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Going nowhere, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god, that was so much fun
Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night

<i>Pitbull</i>:
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened
Never happened

Different night different city
Different girl but its all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy you might run into my past
I don't got a conscience, 
and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bondsmen, heh

One life, two worlds-- English, Spanish 
One night, two girls-- English, Spanish 
She's telling me to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale

<i>Havana Brown</i>:
I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Going nowhere, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god, that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

<i>Pitbull</i>:
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami
