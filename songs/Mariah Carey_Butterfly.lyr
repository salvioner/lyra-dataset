When you love someone so deep they become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could keep you under glass 
Now I understand to hold you I must open up my hands 
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 

Fly abandonedly into the sun
 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly 

I have learned that beauty has to flourish in the light 
Wild horses run unbridled or their spirit dies 
You have given me the courage to be all that I can 
And I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me 
When you're ready to land 

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 

Fly abandonedly into the sun
 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly 

I can't pretend these tears aren't over flowing steadily 
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me 
But I will stand and say goodbye for you'll never be mine 
Until you know the way it feels to fly  

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 

Fly abandonedly into the sun
 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly  

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 

Fly abandonedly into the sun
 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly 

So flutter through the sky 
Butterfly, fly
Spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly
