Blue - the colour suits you
Cool blue
How will you stay this way for ever?
Blue again
It's a lasting chill
To keep you cold as winter

How can I forget you?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you baby?
I'm never gonna give you up

Here it comes again
Here it comes again

Blue - the colour fools you
Cool blue
I'll never stay this way for ever
Blue again
