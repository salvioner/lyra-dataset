My true love has come to call
The type of man I thought was dead and gone
And said, Sparrow, it's you I've come to see
'Cause with you is where I want to be

Oh, with you, with you
You take me higher
With you, with you
The waters parted the sea
With you, the stars shine much brighter
Fallin' into you, with you, with me

There's no way I'd ever resist
Or push away from your tender kiss
I give you my heart for the world to see
'Cause me with you, well it's destiny

Oh, with you, with you
You take me higher
With you, with you
The waters parted the sea
With you, the stars shine much brighter
Fallin' into you, with you, with me

Oh, with you
The stars shine much brighter
Fallin' into you, with you, with you
Oh, with you, with you with me
With you with me
