Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream of Heaven afar
Heavenly host sing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born
