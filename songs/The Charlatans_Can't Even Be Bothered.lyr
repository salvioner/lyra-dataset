One of us must know which way you can go
One of us must know which way you can go

I can see a rainbow coming out of your 
Hole you're God although I never knew a
Prophet I can see a rainbow coming out of your hole

I can't even be bothered, energy breaks me down

Two of us waiting for one to start aging
Two of us waiting for one to low-down
I can see a rainbow coming out of your
Hole. you're blind although I'm under
Pressure. filthy eyes to be with me when I am down
I can't even be bothered, energy breaks me down
I can't even be bothered, shut your face anyway

One of us must know which way the wind blows
I don't although I never knew a prophet
One of us must know which way the wind blows

I can't even be bothered, energy breaks me down
I can't even be bothered, shut your face anyway

Who do you think you are who do you
Think you are and never make the same mistake again
