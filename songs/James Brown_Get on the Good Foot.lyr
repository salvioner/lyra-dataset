Ooh!

Going down to the crib
Let all hang out
Where soulful people knows what it's about-ah
Going down to the crib
And let it all hang out-ah
Where soulful people knows what it's about-ah

Where people do the sign and take your hands-ah
And dancin' to the music James Brown band... mmm

They're dancing on the good foot
I got to get on the good foot
Got to do it on the good foot

They all get together across the tracks
And they PARTY
Ho! On the good foot
You know they dance on the good foot
Dance on the good foot

Ain't nothing goin' on now
But the rent-ah
A whole lotta bills and my money's spent
Mmm
