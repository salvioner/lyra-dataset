Fill my eyes
O lithium sunset
And take this lonesome burden
Of worry from my mind
Take this heartache
Of obsidian darkness
And fold my darkness
Into your yellow light

I've been scattered, I've been shattered
I've been knocked out of the race
But I'll get better
I feel your light upon my face

Heal my soul
O lithium sunset
And I'll ride the turning world
Into another night

See mercury falling...
