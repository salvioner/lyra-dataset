I feel Like, I feel Like Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters, 
Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears in my eyes
hit the swich making sure any mother fucka in tha vicinity 
Blow away and die, 
Kill'em off with an explosion 
Get up bitches, 
Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb, 
Feelin the fury flow out of every follicle in my body 
While you decompose Die with a blunt of dro in yo hand, 
I'm uppin the itchy fo fuckin wit Twista 
If you fuckin wit me come bet so cause it wont 
Be an issue-Got some nuts to come get me 
Then boy you gone get the picture put the flame in my 
Swisher Then hollows penetrate thru yo tissue 
Fuck yo fit up wit yo blood as I hear the cries 
Of yo homies screamin revenge 
Got no mercy on them either go to war wit the 
Intentions to annialate everything you stand for 
Wit the death of myself cause I'm a believer 
The blessings of sacrifice the messenger who 
Cometh after the Christ next 1 to glisten after ice 
Fuckin wit me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice 
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life 
My brother you cant bring harm wit guns I'm 
Armed wit bombs fuck all that shit you carry I got 
Yo obituary a muthafuckin phenomenon-cause I'mma come 
Till they put all of us in a cemetery


Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really wanna 
Fuck wit 

Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us 
Sucide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch 

Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us


Go to war like I'm untochable yellin out bloody murder 
While I'm bustin you 2 deadly fingers squeezing twin 
Triggers steady touchin you screamin like a demon 
Like I'm finger fuckin you 
Just put my body in a room wit the enemy and I got 
A grenade I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch 
Pop 17 sins out the gun clip smoking dro so fire 
I was on 10 after 1 bligg 
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre 
Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula slip the clip in the 
Automatic and get to bustin horrific hollows while you 
Prayin to jesus of Nazarus 
A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's 
Scary wit a Mack in the back of the pelle 
Spectacular how could you dare me I'm already willing to die 
I'm comin back after they bury me 
Its time for yo confessions I be the priest 
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier 
Better become a bible holder as I start to massacre 
Men with a verbal recital that's colder 
Deaths coming closer as you let kamikazi 
Enter yo body careful or you die standin vertical 
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you 
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you
