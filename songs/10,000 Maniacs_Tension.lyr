Frail hinges pivot on a case's door
Commemorative souvenirs from places
Containers change with each occasion

Cellophane encased displaying paper certificate
To credit years of service
A tool of central enterprises

The early hope for permanence
The words, the rings, consistency
And Social Security
The miracles, high tragedy

A thought mistaken for a memory
Dress lengths, assassinations
Fractured family ties and christening

Local posts they list your friends
In order of disappearance
Lawn-scattered tins feed birds
The portion baked for absent guests

Mass edition icon
God sent comfort is your salvation
But who grants absolution
For sins that never were committed

Tension makes a tangle of
Each thought becomes inconvenience
Sound doesn't ever penetrate
As servile edges break and feint

A thought mistaken for a memory
Clear the dust from smiles in boxes
Cross a patterned floor
Recall the voices

A thought mistaken for a memory
Dress lengths, assassinations
Fractured family ties and christening
And christening

Only fractured family ties and christening
And christening
