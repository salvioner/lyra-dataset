Call it bad
My bad my bad influence
Big town holds me back
Big town skins my mind
Small minds wear me down
Spreadading salt on fertile ground
Honest pleasures now forsaken
Drastic measures to be taken
Can't accept your difference
They call it bad influence

Free mind, free soul
It's time for liberation to flow
Free mind, free soul
It's time so let your future unfold

Call it bad
My bad my bad influence
Break out of the mold before the mold sets in
Dangerous walls are closin' in
They twist the truth
Then give it a spin
Love's a grenade, I'll pull the pin

Free mind, free soul
It's time for liberation to flow
Free mind, free soul
It's time so let your future unfold

The circle is wide
Shadows flower into the light
Bad influence
Bad such a bad influence

You think I'm bad
You think I'm bad
Well I'm the most fun that you ever had
So good, so good
But people say I'm a bad influence
Wide mouths, narrow minds
Can't accept your difference
Open season on new ideas
They call it bad influence

Free mind, free soul
It's time for liberation to flow
Free mind, free soul
It's time so let your future unfold

My bad my bad influence
Just a bad influence
My bad my bad influence
Call it bad
My bad my bad influence
Wide mouths with narrow minds
Narrow minds, creak and grind
Rally to a peaceful sound
Let the barriers tumble down
My bad my bad influence
My bad my bad influence
Break out of the mold before the mold sets in
Dangerous walls are closin' in
They twist the truth
Then give it a spin
If love's a grenade, better pull the pin!
Call it bad
My bad my bad influence
