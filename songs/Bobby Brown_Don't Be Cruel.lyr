Girl...the only thing that matters in my life,
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
A no, oh a nooo
Don't be cruel
Girl you need to change your attitude
A no, oh
Don't be cruel

Hey yo cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post, but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my heart  to you
You should be giving me your heart too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
A no, oh a nooo
Don't be cruel
Girl you need to change your attitude
A no, oh
Don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front, and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl it's like a heart attack
I'm a real troop-trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side big dollars I'll clock

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool

Don't be cruel...
A no, oh

We used to hang out tough
Just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad, I can let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Roll to the fact that I want you Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryin' to make a killin'
Though about the dollars I make,
And you were willin'
To be with me, Bobby B.
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You wanna be with me,
You gotta be the same way that another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel

'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
