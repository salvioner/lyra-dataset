Now dis fool name of Terrel
Seems he was doin' swell
Over tha years where he sell
was betta than clientele
my niggas was gettin' big
he slung eva since a kid
and always got glamour rides for all of tha shit he did
he had a bad attitude
nigga selfish and rude
one day he got in a fight in gloom and he gone killed a dude
thats when A.T.F. got hot
surveillance up on tha block
they knew he was runnin' shop
but dis nigga wouldn't stop
terrel was a knucklehead
he said mothafuck a fed
look come if you wanna come and off with you bitches head
surely dem people came
git down on yo face and hand
they took tha dope and choked terrel wit a rope man
he thought he would go to jail
5-0 took tha bitch to hell
they took tha dope and said he got crossed in drug sale



that's how it be happenin'
i tried to warn my nigga but dem people but they snatched him
that's how it be happenin' 
that's how it be happenin'
