In the absence of your love
And in the absence of human touch
I have decided I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because only stone and steel accept my love

In the absence of your smiling face
I traveled all over the place
and I have decided I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because only stone and steel accept my love
I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because only stone and steel accept my love

I'm throwing my arms around Paris because
Nobody wants my love
Nobody wants my love
Nobody needs my love
Nobody wants my love

Yes you made yourself plain
Yes you made yourself very plain
