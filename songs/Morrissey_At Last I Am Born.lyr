At last I am born
Historians note
I am finally born
I once used to chase 
Affection withdrawn
But now I just sit back and yawn
Because I am born, born, born

<i>Look at me now
From difficult child
to spectral hand 
To Claude Brasseur
Oh blah blah blah...</i>

At last I am born
Vulgarians know
I am finally born
I once thought that time 
Accentuates despair
But now I don't actually care
Because I am born, born, born

<i>Look at me now
From difficult child
to spectral hand 
To Claude Brasseur
Oh blah blah blah...</i>

At last I am born
At last I am born
Living the one true free life born
I once thought I 
Had numerous reasons to cry
And I did, but I don't anymore
Because I am born, born, born

At last I am born
At last I am born
It took me a long, long time
But now I am born
I once was a mess 
Of guilt because of the flesh
It's remarkable what you can learn
Once you are born, born, born
Born, born, born
Born, born, born
