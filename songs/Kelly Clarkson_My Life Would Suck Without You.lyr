Guess this means you're sorry, you're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back, all you said before
Like how much you wanted, anyone but me
Said you'd never come back, but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Maybe I was stupid, for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for, trying to pick a fight

I know that I've got issues, but you're pretty messed up too
Either way I've found out, I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Being with you, is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you, but I can't let you go, oh yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you
