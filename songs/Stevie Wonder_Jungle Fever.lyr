Ive got jungle fever, shes got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Shes gone black-boy crazy, Ive gone white-girl hazy
Aint no thinking maybe, were in love
Shes got jungle fever, Ive got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Ive gone white-girl crazy, shes gone black-boy hazy
Were each others baby, were in love

Ive got jungle fever, shes got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Shes gone black-boy crazy, Ive gone white-girl hazy
Aint no thinking maybe, were in love

She cant love me, I cant love her
Cause they say were the wrong color
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking
Like weve done something wrong
Because we show love strong, get real, come on
Calling us names too bad to mention
But we pay them no attention
For color blind are inner feelings
If we feel happiness
And know our loves the best, forget their mess

Ive got jungle fever, shes got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Shes gone black-boy crazy, Ive gone white-girl hazy
Aint no thinking maybe, were in love
Shes got jungle fever, Ive got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Ive gone white-girl crazy, shes gone black-boy hazy
Were each others baby, were in love

Everyones created equal
Hell with all you ignorant people
Trying to stereo type us
You really ought to quit
Cause you dont know jack, you make us sick
Get off my jock, youre trying to ride me
Because I got my girl beside me
Youll only make yourself look stupid
I love youre trying to dis
Cause weve got happiness, I bet youre pissed

Ive got jungle fever, shes got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Shes gone black-boy crazy, Ive gone white-girl hazy
Aint no thinking maybe, were in love
Shes got jungle fever, Ive got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Ive gone white-girl crazy, shes gone black-boy hazy
Were each others baby, were in love

Ive got jungle fever, shes got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Shes gone black-boy crazy, Ive gone white-girl hazy
Aint no thinking maybe, were in love
Shes got jungle fever, Ive got jungle fever
Weve got jungle fever, were in love
Ive gone white-girl crazy, shes gone black-boy hazy
Were each others baby, were in love
