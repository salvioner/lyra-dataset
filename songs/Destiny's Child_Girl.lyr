Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy

We've seen this all before
But he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy

I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to

Girl, I can tell he's been lying

And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you


Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

Girl, I can tell you've been crying

And you needing somebody to talk to

Girl, I can tell he's been lying

And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you


Girl, you don't have to be hiding

Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen ya down like this
What you mean, you don't need us to help
We known each other too well
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girl
And don't you know we love ya

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying

You cannot hide from your friends, girl)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya

Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya
