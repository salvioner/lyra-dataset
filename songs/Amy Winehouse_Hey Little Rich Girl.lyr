I bought you a fur coat 
When you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl

And now little rich girl

Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone 
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong

At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
