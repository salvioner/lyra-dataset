<b>T.I.</b>
Baddabang baddabang
Got a chain you can see through
Graduated to a Range from a Regal
Hit the club and I leave with it 82
That's the difference between me and you
Just how we do it, Remy straight to the head and you chase yours
On a worldwide tour me and Skateboard
Ate more bitches in the lobby on the molly
Pretty sexy yet exotic fill 'em all in my Ferrari yep
I'll probably be menage in before I put the car in parkin'
Got 'em running upstairs got 'em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there
I solemnly swear, I will not share
This game with a lame, let him learn for himself
I don't owe a nigga shit, better earn for himself
Quit tripping on me, be concerned with yourself
