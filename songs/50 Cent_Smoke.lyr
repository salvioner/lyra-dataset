Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke

The way your body roll I'ma lose control
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke


Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feeling Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearing the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police coming, you like, put this shit out

You like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke
And you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to working her hips you know the temperature rise
Oh lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinking damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: A house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the grey hound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wanting is temporary like some smoke gon' get it

You like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke
And you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

Everybody showing the love when she at the door
Turn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole
I'm trying to get it and hit it, I don't wanna pass that
Got me addicted, I'm tripping, where the stash at?
Baby, baby, don't you know?
Baby, baby, you're just like smoke

You like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke
And you got me high

High

Girl what the fuck you done to me
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke
