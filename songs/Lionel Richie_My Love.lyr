I've been through so many changes in my life woman
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind
And I ain't never said how much I need you sugar
But I should need you by my side

My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time

Life with me I know for sure it ain't be easy
But you stayed with me anyway
And even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving
I'm so glad you stayed

My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time

You've been my friend and you've been my lover, oh lord
Honey you're everything I need
You've made my love so strong now I know where I belong
Oh girl you'll never have to worry
Oh baby any more, any more

My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time
