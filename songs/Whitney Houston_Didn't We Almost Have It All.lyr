Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it all
