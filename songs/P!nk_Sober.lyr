I don't wanna be the girl
Who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never 
Wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call
At 4 o'clock in the morning
'cause I'm the only one you know
In the world that won't be home 

Ahh, the sun is blinding 
I stayed up again 
Oohh, I am finding 
That's not the way I want my story to end 

I'm safe up high 
Nothing can touch me 
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain inside 
You're my protection 
How do I feel this good sober? 

I don't wanna be the girl
Who has to fill the silence 
The quiet scares me 
Cause it screams the truth 
Please don't tell me that 
We had that conversation 
I won't remember, save your breath
'cause what's the use? 

Ahh, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly,
"Come and play"
Ahh, I am falling 
And if I let myself go
I'm the only one to blame 

I'm safe up high 
Nothing can touch me 
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain inside 
You're like perfection 
How do I feel this good sober? 

I'm coming down, coming down, coming down 
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round 
Looking for myself, sober
I'm coming down, coming down, coming down 
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round 
Looking for myself, sober

When it's good, then it's good
It's so good till it goes bad 
Till you're trying to find
The you that you once had 
I have heard myself cry, "Never again"
Broken down in agony
Just trying to find a friend

I'm safe up high 
Nothing can touch me 
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain inside 
You're like perfection 
How do I feel this good sober 

I'm safe up high 
Nothing can touch me 
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain inside 
You're like perfection 
How do I feel this good sober? 

Will I ever feel this good sober? 
Tell me, No no no no no pain 
How do I feel this good sober?
