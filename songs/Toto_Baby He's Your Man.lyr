Well it's 2 a. m.
You're just getting in
Soon you'll be creepin' into bed
Later you'll pretend you were out with a friend
But I'm still inside your head

I don't understand
You say I'm your man
When it's clear you're seein' another
You can call me a fool for just loving' you
But girl I'll never find another

If you think he'll love you better
Your every wish is his command
Baby he's your man

Baby he's your man

Well, you spoke your mind
But I still can't find what's wrong with you and me
I got something' to say
And baby come what may
Baby we were never meant to be

So I want you to know
I can't let him go
'Til find a love that's real
I don't like this game
I don't need this pain
I'm just saying what I feel

I know he can love me better
My every wish is his command

Baby he's my man

Now I know I should love you better

Oh, my every every wish is his command

Baby he's your
Baby he's my
Baby he's your man
Baby he's my man
