White knuckles
And sweaty palms from
Hangin' on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another
Headache again tonight

Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been cryin', I've been cryin'
I've been dyin' over you

Tie a knot, in the rope
Tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting
That we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say
When I say there is nothing left

No more sick, whiskey dick
No more battles from me
You'll be callin' a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep

I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancin' alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Blow me one last kiss
Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the why's
Will all be crystal clear

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Na na na na
Da da da da
Na na na na
Da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

Na na na na
Da da da da
Na na na na
Da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
