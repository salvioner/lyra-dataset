Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my hand like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Talk to me

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

Here it goes again
Here it goes again

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
It is really with you

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like at new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my hand like a memory
Falling on my hand like a new emotion
