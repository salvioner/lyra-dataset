The first time I saw her
She was wearing scarves of white
That little spark between us
Took only seconds to ignite
And then it occured to me
But suddenly I was standing there alone
On the Spanish steps of Rome 

I kept searching through the allies
Kept searching through the catacombes that night
I closed my eyes and threw a coin in the fountain
She was nowhere insight
I wandered through the holy city
Like a beggar beneath the moon lit dome
Near the Spanish steps of Rome 

I heard a voice as I looked through my fingers
And saw the old monsigneur
He gave me his blessing and said to me:
"Don't try and please her"
And then I heard her singing like some diva
Parched upon her throne
On the Spanish steps of Rome 

Now I know I should have listened
When he warned me - He warned me not to follow
I noticed that the statues eyes
Were all sunken and hollow
She let hose young wolves do their dirty deeds
While she lay inside her home
On the Spanish steps of Rome
