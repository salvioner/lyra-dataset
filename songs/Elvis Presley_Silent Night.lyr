Silent night, holy night.
All is calm, all is bright.
'round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night.
Shepherds quake at the sight.
Glorious strains from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia.
Christ the saviour is born,
Christ the saviour is born.
