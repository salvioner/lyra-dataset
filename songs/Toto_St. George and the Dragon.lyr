Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra
Is he wearing a familiar face
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue
With the princess dipped in lace
Does he know that I'm a soldier of fortune
And not a victim of circumstance
We drew lots for his soft underbelly
Now his fate is sealed with my lance

I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way

Is it true that he's a mighty warrior
And a viper of the first degree
I've been sentenced here to slay the giant
Geld this fear I cannot see

Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra
Is he wearing a familiar face
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue
In the slums of Satan's grace

I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way
