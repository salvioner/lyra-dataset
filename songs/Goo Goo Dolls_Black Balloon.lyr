Baby's black balloon makes her fly
I almost fell into that hole in your life
And you're not thinking about tomorrow
'Cause you were the same as me
But on your knees

A thousand other boys could never reach you
How could I have been the one?
I saw the world spin beneath you
And scatter like ice from the spoon
That was your womb

Comin' down, the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallowed the light from the sun
Inside your room, yeah

Comin' down, the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Always someone's prayer

And there's no time left for losin'
When you stand they fall, yeah

Comin' down, the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm...

Comin' down, the years turn over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and
All because I'm...

And I'll become
What you became to me
e to me
