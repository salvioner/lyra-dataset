We were on this car trip and I was looking at these rows and rows of trees all along the highway.
I don't know what kind of trees, apples or something.
There were just like thousands and thousands of rows with a thousand trees each.
And I picked one tree that I could see about eight trees back in this one row in the middle.
Just one in a billion, and that's how I felt.
