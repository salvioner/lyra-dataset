Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate, love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate
Designate your love as fate
A one-world state as human freight
The number eight, a white/black state
A gentle trait, a broken crate
A heavyweight or just too late
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate
Now devastate, appreciate
Depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, a truth dilate
Special date, the animal we ate
A guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, the youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate, reinstate
Liberate, too moderate
Recreate or detonate
Annihilate, atomic fate 
Mediate, clear the slate
Activate, now radiate
A perfect state, a food on plate
Gravitate, the Earth's own weight
Designate your love as fate
At ninety-eight we all rotate 
Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate, love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate
Designate your love as fate
A one-world state as human freight
The number eight, a white/black state
A gentle trait, the broken crate
A heavyweight or just too late
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate
Now devastate, appreciate
Depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, truth dilate
The special date, the animals we ate
Guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, a youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate and reinstate 
And liberate
To liberate 
Liberate 
Liberate
