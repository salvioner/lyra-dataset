Oh I love you in the morning 
When the sun comes shinning through
And I love you in the daylight
When the sheets turn pale blue
Well I want to be your lover
And to have you all alone
But I've always got another 
And I haven't got a home
Someday I'll stop my traveling 
Settle down with you
And I'll see you in the daylight 
And the sheets turn pale blue
