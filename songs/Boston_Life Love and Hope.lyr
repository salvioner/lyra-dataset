Everybody says they do, but you know they don't
They say they're looking out for you, but you know they won't
Can't you see I believe ... I'm living on faith
On my knees, and I can see the promise I can make

And life has taken me so far from shore
And I, I'm breaking free, I see what life is for
You take a little time for love but don't give in
And never open up the door, how can you win? Yeah,
Can't you see I survive ... just living on faith
On my knees but I'll arrive, and stand by your side

'Cause love has taken me, it's opened the door
And I, I'm breaking free, I see what love is for
Oh, I see what love is for
And I'm not afraid anymore

People searching for the truth they can't find
And everybody looks at you, but they're so blind
They're all lining up behind a door, they can't get in
They send another soul to war, it's such a sin
Can't you see I survive ... just living on faith?
On my knees but I'll arrive to stand by your side

And hope has taken me, it's opened the door
And I, I'm breaking free, I see what hope is for
I see what hope is for
No I'm not afraid anymore
