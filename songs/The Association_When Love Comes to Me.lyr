Can't believe you got that attitude
You've been so cold and rude
Baby, when you're gonna give it up
Tell me are we breaking up?

I know what you wanna do
You wanna leave me blue, you

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer

You've been telling everyone and all
Just how I'm gonna fall
When I do, you're gonna be right there
To walk away and show me you don't care

I know what you wanna do
You wanna leave me blue, you

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer

I remember when
She goes in my skin
Though it's very thin
She thinks she's gonna win

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
