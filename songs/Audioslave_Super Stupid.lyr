Super stupid bought a nickel bag,
thought it was coke but it was skag.
Super stupid did a one on one,
then his eyes began to water and his nose began to run.

Oh, stupid with your ups and downs,
your maggot brain, your grins and frowns.
Super stupid you are here today,
you lost the fight and the winner is fear.
