Now if you're thinkin' 'bout a love that left you
Thinkin' you should hide away
Girl I think it's wrong 
You just try to be strong now babe
Listen to what I've got to say
I know the feelin' that you feel today

But don't be afraid of love

Tell you how I feel about you
Tell you what you want to hear
Tell you that it's true
But it's all up to you now babe
Don't let your love disappear
Can't believe that I'll be stayin' here

But don't be afraid of love

Baby don't you know good love is hard to find
Don't you think I know what's goin' through your mind
One man left you cryin' so you shut the door
Just let me inside that's what my love is for

Tell you how I feel about you
Tell you what you want to hear
Tell you that it's true
But it's all up to you now babe
Don't let your love disappear
Can't believe that I'll be stayin' here

But don't be afraid of love
