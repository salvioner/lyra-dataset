Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life

I am alive again
I am alive again

All the empty yesterdays have disappeared
Now that you have filled my life with love
No one else could ever mean so much to me
Every day my high lasts longer
As our love grows ever stronger

Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life

I am alive again
I am alive again

When you gave your love to me tou changed my life
Dreams that once seemed hopeless come with ease
Thank you, girl, for being just the way you are
I would never try to change you
All I live for is to love you

I'm feeling alive
I'm feeling alive again
Don't you know I'm feeling alive

Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life

I am alive again

Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life

I am alive again
