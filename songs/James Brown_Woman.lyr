I'm a man

I'm a man

What makes a man break up inside?
And what makes a man give up his pride?
What makes a man feel he's began to fail?
And when he can't win he thinks he even can't tell me


Say it again

Say it again

I ask you

What makes a man jealous of each other?
So tacturned against his brother, now here's the reason
She makes a cloudy day seem bright
She makes a nightmare turn into the warmest night

You know, she makes trouble seem so, so
She can turn a hardship and she makes it so easy to cross
She brings life into the world over and over again
No man in the world could ever bear those pains

She never lets you know when se feels bad
And she smiles when she feels sad
And when you and when you feel blue
She know her place right beside you

Right beside you and I wanna know
What makes a man stop tiring?
And who's the only one
Can stop a baby from crying?
