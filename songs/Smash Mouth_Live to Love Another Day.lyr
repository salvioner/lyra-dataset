I get no love, I get no conversation
She's a hot mess comin' with a lot of motivation
I'll take 20 to 1 she's got a man at home waiting
But, who cares, you know I'm just saying

Bet there's a room where we can get away and hide
A little dark corner where we can lead a life of crime
I bet she'd like to just pretend she's mine
Mess around and slide it right over the line

Comin' on, comin' on, she's comin' on to me
Oh my God, I swear her eyes were just undressing me
Everything's a blur, look at her, she'll make you pay
Hey hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!
Hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!

It's 2 a.m. on the streets, I think it's closing time
I got bruises in places I can't even find
Been walking home all alone, can't get her off my mind
Hey, is that her, coming up from behind

Comin' on, comin' on, she's comin' on to me
Oh my God, I swear her eyes were just undressing me
Everything's a blur, look at her, she'll make you pay
Hey hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!
Hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!

I could take her home and nobody'd know
She could take me where I really wanna go

I need to play it real cool right now
Pump the brakes and dial it down

Comin' on, comin' on, she's comin' on to me
Oh my God, I swear her eyes were just undressing me
Everything's a blur, look at her, she'll make you pay
Hey hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!

Comin' on, comin' on, she's comin' on to me
Oh my God, I swear her eyes were just undressing me
Everything's a blur, look at her, she'll make you pay
Hey hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!
Hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!
Hey hey hey hey
Live to love another day!
