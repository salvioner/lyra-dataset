Listen to the grass that's out there blowin'
Look at that tractor just there sittin'
It's my name that the bottle's callin'
Listen to the goddamn song I'm singin'

Drink your wine, listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump, that's the ticket, uh-huh

Look at that doggy sittin' on the stairs
Look at that star shinin' way up there
Think of all the things that they're doin' in jail
Think of all the rich ones out on bail

Drink your wine, listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump, that's the ticket, uh-huh

Look at the TV, it's all crappy
Look at the bald spot on yer pappy
Listen to his wheatfield out there blowin'
Hope its doin' better than his hair at growin'

Drink your wine, listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump, that's the ticket, uh-huh
