Reintroduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah I been running but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You made my heartbeat keep pumping
Why it ain't turning up so loud

Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear the thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

Here we are, we are, we are, we are

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I've seen for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

I went in all the way and thought I could get in and out
She said relax, you gonna be here for a while
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is I'm learning to loving
And I ain't gonna turn it down

The fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear the thief
Once the music takes you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we are

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

Here we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!


And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I've seen for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
