You are the bravest man I've ever met 
You unreluctant at treacherous ledge 
Oh You are the sexiest man I've ever been with 
Oh you, never hotter than with armor spent 

When you do what you do to provide
How you land in the soft as you fortify
This is in praise of the vulnerable man
Why won't you lead the rest of your cavalry home?

You, with your eyes mix strength with abandon
You with your new kind of heroism
And I bow, and I bow down to you
To the grace that it takes to melt on through

This is in praise of the vulnerable man
Why won't you lead the rest of your cavalry home?
This is a thank you for letting me in
Indeed in praise of the vulnerable man

You are the greatest man I've ever met
You the stealth setter of new precedents
And I vow, and I vow to be true
And I vow, and I vow not to take advantage

This is in praise of the vulnerable man
Why won't you lead the rest of your cavalry home?
This is a thank you for letting me in
Indeed in praise of the vulnerable man

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
