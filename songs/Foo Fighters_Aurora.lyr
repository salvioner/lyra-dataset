You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself
And you bleed and breathe the air
And it's on and on and on and on and on

I just kinda died for you
You just kinda stared at me
We will always have the chance
We can do this one more time

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Take me now, we can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

You believe there's somewhere else
Where it's easier than this
And you see outside yourself
And you buy the hole you'll fill
And still it's on and on and on and on and on

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time

On and on and on aurora wait for everyone
Wait till the last one's done
