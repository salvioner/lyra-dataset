Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
Ooh, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

Home in one month
Couldn't feel better if I tried
Won't even write
It's better that'll be a surprise
I can't expect to be a household word
I don't mind, just let me inside
I don't expect to be seen or heard
I won't mind, I've nothin' to hide

Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Ooh, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

Home in one week
Gettin' so much closer all the time
Seems like overnight
It's better that'll be a surprise

We shouldn't get to be too close friends
I don't mind, I've nothin' to hide
We couldn't get to be too close friends
You won't mind if you've nothin' to hide

Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Oo, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

Don't stop to think what you're doin'
I'll surprise you anytime
Don't stop to do what you're thinkin'
You're just wastin' your time

Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Oo, I hope everyone missed you
I really want you to stay
