Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart...
Sin in my heart flying like a dart
Oh sin in my heart

It's beginning to start...
When you're lying like a tart
Oh sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet
Oh sin in my heart
It's short and sweet

Sin in my heart...
Swift as a dart sin in my heart
Oh sin in my heart

When you grovel at my feet
Keep it short and sweet
Sin in my heart...
