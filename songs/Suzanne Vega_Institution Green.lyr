Institution green
The walls are cracked and dim
And we are standing in a line
Waiting for our faces to be seen


Institution green
Watch the floor and cound the hours
None will meet my eyes
Private people in this public place


I wonder if they'll take a look
Find my name inside that book
Lose me on the printed page
Where to point the aimless rage


I cast my vote upon this earth
Take my place for what it's worth
Hunger for a pair of eyes
To notice and to regognize


Institution green
A woman stands behind a table
She will call my name
After that I'll be admitted in


I wonder if she'll take a look
Find my name inside that book
Lose me on the printed page
Where to point the aimless rage


I cast my vote upon this earth
Take my place for what it's worth
Hunger for a pair of eyes
To notice and to regognize


Institution green
Teach me how to pull the lever
Push the curtain closed
Take what's needed then just
Let me go
