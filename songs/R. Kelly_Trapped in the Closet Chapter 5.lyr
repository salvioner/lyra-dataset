And now, I'm like
"Well, well, well,
What the Biggie is this
A condom in my bed
Ya better start talkin, biggie
'Fore I take a match and
Burn the biggie down!"
I said You better start talkin
And start talkin right god damn now!
Then she said "Baby,
I'm so speechless!"
Then I said "My baby,
You gone be breathless,
If ya dont start talkin quick
Woman, I'm gone have a Big Pun!
You dont know what ya biggie wit!
Girl ya better cut the ruggin'!"

Now its obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, G Unit said "I smell Pussy"
Now I'm sniffin and lookin around
Suspicious like someone's here
Then I looked in her eyes and in her eyes
There was so much fear
Pull out my gun said "Is he still here?"
She shook her head and said "Naw."
I'm checkin behind every door
She cried out "He left right after you called!"
I said "What the fuck was you thinkin
You thought that I wouldnt find this out?"
Then I said "You must be crazy or on crack to have somebody off up in my muthafuckin house!

She hopped up and said "That's enough!"
She said "I cant take no more!"
And then she said "You made your point,
But now its time to even the score!"
She said "I know all about last night,
And where you went when you left the club."
Said "Thats right, nigga I was there
Wit this guy in the back of the club."
I said "I thought you was wit yo girls!"
She said "I thought you was wit yo guys!"
She said "You was at that bitch's house,
And dont even try to act suprised!"
Said "Babe", she said "Shut up
Dont you say a word!
It aint nothin you can say,
That I aint already heard."

Then I said "Woman, dont you try to turn it all around
Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house!"
Then she said "You're right about that
Somethin did go down, but I dont have to turn it around,
Cause what goes around comes back around!"
I'm movin a little closer to her
She's trippin over the furniture
She said "Wait first, just let me explain
I said "No need to, just give me his name!"
And then she said "Uh...uh..."
I say "'Uh...' what?"
She said "Please sit down in a chair!"
And I say "No, I'm standin' up!"
And she cries out "I'm so scared to tell you because of what ya might do!"
And I screamed "Look girl you better give me this man's name and I'm not playin wit you!"

She says "Okay", wipes her nose and asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself, said "It sound familiar--"
I said "I probably know her if I seen her."
Then I say "Anyway girl, what the hell does that got to do with this man?!"
She said "He knows my girl Roxanne."
I said "Who the hell is Roxanne?!"
Then she says "Roxanne's a friend of mine who know with this guy named Chuck,
Chuck's cool wit this guy name Rufus."
And I'm sittin here like 'What the fuck?!?!'
Then she says "Rufus wife, Kathy.
We both went to high school.
She introduced me to the policeman that stopped you..."
