I can feel the heat, no one has to tell me
It's so good, once it starts I'll never let go
I can feel the beat like a Spanish dancer
Under my feet, making the world go 'round, I can't come down
You can't hold me when I get to feeling this way
It's all over, I'm inside that music that's playing
It takes me out across the wall
It makes my life a carnival
I go out on the street and take my chances
Don't even have to ask, I know the answers
