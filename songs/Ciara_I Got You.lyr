I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing

More than you
I got everything
I've got you

We went walking through the hills
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hell storm came and yelled,
"You need to let go, you've got no control. No."
