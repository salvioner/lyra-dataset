You can hardly wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine
And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Everytime he walks by

And if your feelin down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when your makin' love
He's everything you've been dreamin' of
Oh baby

Chorus:
I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Tellin' me more
Than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man

You don't see me baby

You probly spend hours on the phone
Talkin bout nothin' at all
It doesn't matter what the conversation
Just as long as he calls

Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
And you'll wipe away
Each others tears
Your face lights up whenever he appears

Chorus

I see you all the time baby
Huh, the way you look at him
I wish it was me sweetheart
Boy I wish it was me
But I guess it never will be

Chorus twice

Oh oh oh
oh baby
The invisible man
You don't see me girl
But I love you
Yes I love you
The invisible man
Oh oh oh
Ya ya
The invisible man
Baby, baby, baby
aby, baby, baby
