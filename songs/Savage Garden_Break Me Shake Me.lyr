I never thought I'd change my opinion again 
But you moved me in a way that I've never known 
You moved me in a way that I've never known 

But straight away you just moved into position again 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 

So break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 

Oh-no oh-no oh-no

So you're the kind who deals with the games in the mind
You confused me in a way that I've never known
You confused me in a way that I've never known

So break me shake me hate me take me over
When the madness stops, then you will be alone
So won't you break me shake me hate me take me over
When the madness stops, then you will be alone

Oh-no oh-no

She says, "I can help you, but what do you say
But it's not free baby, you'll have to pay."
You just keep me contemplatin', that your soul is slowly fadin'

God don't you know that I live with a ton of regret
'Cause I used to move you in a way that you've never known
But then I accused you in a way that you've never known
But you hurt me in a way that I've never known

Break me shake me hate me take me over
When the madness stops, then you will be alone
So won't you break me shake me hate me take me over
When the madness stops, then you will be alone



You'll be, you'll be alone
Break me shake me hate me take me make me
Fake me break me shake me hate me take me
Break me
