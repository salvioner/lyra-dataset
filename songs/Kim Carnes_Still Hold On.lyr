If I told you tonight that I loved you
Would you walk my way would you say
Lies that I wanted to hear
If I told you tonight that I need you
Would you break my heart would you start
Wearing me down again

I feel so lonely when I'm with I'm with you
But I'm so lonely when you're gone
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
I still hold on

If I told you tonight I was leaving
Would you call my name take the blame
Turn it all around again
'Cause you know I love you
And worth the heartbreak we make
But I still hold on I still hold on

I feel so lonely when I'm with I'm with you
But I'm so lonely when you're gone
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
I still hold on
