<b>Rita Ora:</b>
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

<b>Iggy Azalea:</b>
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
B-by m-me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got him mirrored 
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

<b>Rita Ora (Iggy Azalea):</b>
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace






I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

<i>Black-black widow, baby</i>)

<b>Iggy Azalea:</b>
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it

Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, or quit it
'Cause this here's a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh

<b>Rita Ora (Iggy Azalea):</b>

But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace





You should've known better than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

<i>Bla-bla-black, black widow, baby</i>)
