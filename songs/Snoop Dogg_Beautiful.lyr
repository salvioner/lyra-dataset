Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Beautiful, I just want you to know

Beautiful, I just want you to know


I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on baby boo, you gotsta get into it
Don't fool with the playa with the cool whip
Yeah-yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, lemme put you in the mood and
Little cutie looking like a student
Long hair, with ya big, fat booty
Back in the days you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp pimp-fluid
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch "Clueless"
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know ooh girl that you is:

Beautiful, I just want you to know

Beautiful, I just want you to know


When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow moving
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeaking when we screwing
Now she's yelling, hollering out "Snoop!" and
Hooting, hollering; hollering, hooting
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, think, black, and curly like you're Cuban
Keep grooving, that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in


Beautiful, I just want you to know

Beautiful, I just want you to know


See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!
See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!

Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and

On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you so beautiful

Beautiful, I just want you to know

Beautiful, I just want you to know


See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!
See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!
See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!
See I just want you
To know that you are really special...
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!
