We were lovers in a past life,
I can see it in your green eyes,
Maybe you were one of my wives,
In the long lost tribe.

There's just somethin' 'bout you I know,
Started centuries ago though,
You see your kiss is like a lost ghost,
Only I would know.

But I, I keep on falling for you,
Time after time, time after time.
I'll make you mine, time after,
Time after time.

Seems milleniums ago, love,
We were nothing more than stardust,
Just the galaxy beneath us,
We found weight.

Then we made it through the Ice Age,
But I lost you in the crusades,
I build the pyramids for you, babe,
Just to see your face.

But I, I keep on falling for you,
Time after time, time after time.
I'll make you mine, time after,
Time after time, yeah.
