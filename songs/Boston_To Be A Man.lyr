What does it take to be a man?
What does it take to see 
It's all heart and soul
A gentle hand? 
So easy to want and so hard to give
How can you be a man
'Till you see beyond the life you live?
Oh, what does it take to be a man? 

We can be blind, but a man tries to see
It takes tenderness
For a man to be what he can be 
And what does it mean
If you're weak or strong?
A gentle feelin'
can make it right or make it wrong
What does it take to be a man? 

The will to give and not receive
The strength to say what you believe
The heart to feel what others feel inside
To see what they can see 

A man is somethin' that's real
It's not what you are
It's what you can feel
It can't be too late
To look through the hate and see
I know that's what a man can be
