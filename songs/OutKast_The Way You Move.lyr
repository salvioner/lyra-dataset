Boom, boom, boom

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a li'l actin'

Now that's for anyone askin', gimme one, pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cummin' out the side of ya face
We tappin' right into ya memory banks, thanks

So click-it or ticket, let's see your seatbelt fastened
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the backseat wrasslin'
Speakerboxx vibratin' the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag

But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can ya feel that B-A-S-S bass
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can ya feel that B-A-S-S bass

I like the way you move
I like the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turnin' left, turnin' right, are they lookin' at me?
Well, I was lookin' at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feelin' like a man-whore

Especially the big girl, big girls need love too
No discrimination here, squirrel
So keep ya hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, ya big freak

Skinny, slim women got the camel-toe within 'em
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "timber" when you fall through the chopshop

Take a deep breath and exhale
You ex-male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Well let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on da low, hoe

I like the way you move
I like the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey baby, girl don't you it
Come on lady, dance all around me
<i>(You look so fine, look so fine)</i>
Drive me outta my mind, out of my mind, out of my mind <i>(aww baby)</i>
If I could, I would just leave with you, baby
Wooh, 'cause you light me and excite me
And you know you got me, baby wooh

I like the way you move
I like the way you move <i>(ooh, you so sexy baby)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move <i>(I love the way you move)</i>
I love the way you move <i>(ooh, sexy)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I like the way you move
I like the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move <i>(wooh)</i>
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
