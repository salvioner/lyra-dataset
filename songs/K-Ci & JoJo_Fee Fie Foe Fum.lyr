Ohh baby
You been leaving every night at the very same time
You claim you've been going to work
But I ain't seen one damn dime babe
Does this job require that you I bring a night gown trim in lace
Cause the one that I just bought for you disappeared without a trace
Late at night I hold my pillow tight
And I wished that it was you
I'm up till 6:00 when you turned the lock
Feeling like I'm abused
Caused baby I think you doing me wrong
Fee fie foe fum
Got a feeling you've been creeping with someone
How could you do this to me
Thought that you would really love me
Fee fie foe fum
Got a feeling you've been creeping with someone
How could you do this to me
Thought that you would really love me
Listen baby
How could you try to lay me like I was your fool
Why stray if you want to play
Baby girl you go to move
Someone called me last night
He didn't leave his name
All he said to me was watch your back
Cause your girl is playing games
Late at night I hold my pillow tight
And I wish that it was you
I'm up till 6:00
When you turn the lock
Feel like I've been abused
Cause you got me thinking
You doing me wrong
Fee fie foe fum
Got a feeling you've been creeping with someone
How could you do this to me
Thought that you would really love me
