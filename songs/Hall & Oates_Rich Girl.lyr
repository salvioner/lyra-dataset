You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far

And don't you know, don't you know 
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong

'Cause you're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money, but it won't get you too far, get you too far

High and dry out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give
'Cause you'd rather live for the thrill of it all

Oh, you're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Say money, but it won't get you too far, get you too far

And you say
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
You're a rich girl, a rich girl
Oh, you're a rich, bitch girl, yeah
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Oh, won't get ya too far
