I was crazy when I said I didn't love you,
From the first time that I ever saw you,
The emotions running deep underneath my skin,
Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin.

So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.

I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms.



If my heart is outa place move over,
I coulda told you how it hurts, coulda told ya.
And now I want you I can feel it in my heartbeat,
It's like a race like I'm running in a track meet.

So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.

I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms,
I wanna wake up in your arms.
