So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales it never fails

You lyin' so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you? Barracuda
Oh

Back over time we were all tryin' for free
You met the porpoise and me, oh
No right, no wrong selling a song
A name whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, barracuda
Oh, yeah

"Sell me, sell you", the porpoise said
"Dive down deep, now, save my head"
You
I think that you got the blues, too

All that night and all the next
Swam without lookin' back
Made for the western pools
Silly, silly fools

The real thing don't do the trick
No, you better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ohh, barra-barracuda, yeah

Ooh, hey!
