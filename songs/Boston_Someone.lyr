I hear you won't even say my name
I know things could never be the same

But whenever I call your number
You're not at home, don't hear the phone
Whenever I start to wonder
Are you alone, are you alone

Someone won't go to sleep tonight
Someone is gonna hurt inside

They say you receive the love you give
Someday you'll believe it's how I live

But when ever I call your number
I'm all alone and on my own
Whenever I start to wonder
The things you said, the words I read

Someone won't go to sleep tonight
Someone is gonna hurt inside

Someone like me, someone like me, like me

Someone won't go to sleep tonight
Someone is gonna hurt inside

Someone won't go to sleep tonight
Someone is gonna hurt inside
