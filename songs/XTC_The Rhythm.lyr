He makes a beeline for the place 
Where he gets his only ace 
Sometimes he's standing in the rain 
Oh Gene Kelly's hat and cane 

He has the Rhythm in his head 
He has the Rhythm, sing! 

It's chaotic at the bar 
B & O those sweaty drops 
We are all mesmorized 
To the thing we have inside 

Inside, outside, eastside, West 
We kill the beast 
Yourside, myside, worlds collide, yes 
We kill the beast
