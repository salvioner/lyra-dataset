You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that? 
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again...

I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me
Now, can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more she gave it all to me
Now, can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know
'Cause here I go again...

I love you. I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly 
Love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?

How can I tell you about my loved one?

How can I tell you about my loved one?

I love you. I love you.
