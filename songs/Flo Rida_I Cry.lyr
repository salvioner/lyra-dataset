I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors

Norway, no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in an hour
Heard about the news, all day went sour

Lil' mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just like the president's cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless

Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I or jealousy was not oppressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket

Clean next, get a call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck, just kill critics
Bugatti never when I'm rich, just God fearing

Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr. Mike Caren, tell his Billie jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck, or Lee Prince Perries

Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing
I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know
It's all better now

When I need a healing
I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know
It's all better now

When I need a healing
I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know
It's all better now

When I need a healing
I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know
It's all better now

I know
I know
I know
I know
I, I, I, I
When I think of letting go, go, go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
