I caught you looking at yourself
Don't worry about it, you look fine
How'd you get your hair so tight?
Kicking things, you might as well fight
It's January, you've got a tan
I gotta hand it to ya, man
You're the bull of the ball
Trying to stand tall
Thinking you can take 'em all



I caught you looking at yourself
I bet you've got overhead cams
Personalized plates and all
Your truck's probably ten feet tall
Bet you say you do it a lot
Bet you don't do it at all
You try to get it up
Might as well errupt
Thinking you could take 'em all





You don't get it
You never will
Flirting with that macho overkill
Seeing everything as if it was a sport
All you'll ever win is a case of warts
Cookie cutter man, you all look alike
Drink 'em up, drink 'em up
Fight fight fight
Move it with the man
Got a tongue in cheek
Don't recreate
Please please please

Bet you say you do it a lot
Bet you don't do it at all
Can't get laid, na na na




I'm I'm I'm I'm
Sorry, so sorry, I'm sorry
Sorry, so sorry, I'm so sorry
Sorry about your penis

You don't get it
You never will
Flirting with that macho overkill
Seeing everything as if it was a sport
All you'll ever win is a case of warts
Cookie cutter man, you all look alike
Drink 'em up, drink 'em up
Fight fight fight
