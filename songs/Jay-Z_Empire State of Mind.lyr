Yeah
Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem,  all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot: 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but B.K. is from Texas
Now I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
I made you hot nigga

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair they act like they forgot how to add

Eight million stories out there in the naked
City it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug Special Ed <i>"I got it made"</i>
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade

Three-dice Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York <i>(Welcome to the bright lights, baby)</i>
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
Welcome to the bright light

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties who sipping life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple Eve

Caught up in the in-crowd
Now you're in-style, and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
