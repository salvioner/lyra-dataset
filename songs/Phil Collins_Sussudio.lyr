There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-Sussudio oh, oh

Oh, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Su--su-su-sussudio oh, oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio, oh

Ah, she's all I need all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I'll say the word
Su-Sussudio oh, oh oh

Just say the word
Ooh, just say the word
Just say the word
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Sussdio
Su-Sussdio

Just say the word
Su-Sussdio
Just say the word, oh
Just say the word
