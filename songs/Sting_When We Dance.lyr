If he loved you 
Like I love you 
I would walk away in shame 
I'd move town
I'd change my name 

When he watches you 
When he counts to buy your soul 
On your hand his golden rings 
Like he owns a bird that sings 

When we dance 
Angels will run and hide their wings 

The priest has said my soul's salvation 
Is in the balance of the angels 
And underneath the wheels of passion 
I keep the faith in my fashion 

When we dance 
Angels will run and hide their wings 

I'm still in love with you

When we dance
Angels will run and hide their wings


Give you all I've got to give
I'm gonna love you more than life
If you'll only be my wife 
I'm gonna love you night and day 
I'm gonna try in every way)

When we dance
Angels will run and hide their wings


Give you all I've got to give 
I would love you more than life 
If you'll only be my wife)

If I could break down these walls 
And shout my name at heaven's gate 
I'd take these hands 
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken 
And heaven's no longer above 
Hellfire's a promise away 
I'd still be saying 
I'm still in love, still in love..

He won't love you 
Like I love you 
He won't care for you this way 
He'll mistreat you if you stay 

Come and live with me 
We'll have children of our own 
I would love you more than life 
If you'll come and be my wife 

When we dance
Angels will run and hide their wings


If you'd only be my wife
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way
I'm gonna find a place to live
Give you all I got to give)

When we dance
Angels will run and hide their wings


If you'd only be my wife
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way
I'm gonna find a place to live
Give you all I got to give)


If you'd only be my wife
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way
I'm gonna find a place to live
Give you all I got to give)

When we dance


If you'd only be my wife
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way)

I had a dream last night
I dreamt you were by my side
Walking with me, baby
My heart was filled with pride
I had a dream last night
d with pride
I had a dream last night
