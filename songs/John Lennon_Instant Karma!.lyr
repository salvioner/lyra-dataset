Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you 'round the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead

What in the world you thinking of?
Laughing in the face of love
What on Earth you tryin' to do?
It's up to you
Yeah, you

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna look you right in the face
Better get yourself together, darling
Join the human race

How in the world you gonna see?
Laughin' at fools like me
Who on Earth d'you think you are
A superstar?
Well, right you are

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Everyone, c'mon

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Everyone you meet

Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on Earth are you there
When you're everywhere
Come and get your share

Well, we all shine on
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
C'mon and on and on, on, on

Yeah, yeah
Alright
Uh-huh
Ah

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
On and on and on, on and on

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
