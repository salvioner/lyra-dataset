It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind."

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind."

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind."

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run from east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind."

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind."

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
