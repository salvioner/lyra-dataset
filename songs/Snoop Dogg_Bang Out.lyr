Bang out, til the sun comes up 
The wheels fall off in the parking lot
Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me sleepin
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
Cause I bang out,shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass buck naked while you wit ya bitch
Cause I bang out


I toss up the set 
I walk up in this bitch with some gold on my neck
Yeah nigga, I controlling the set, rock and rollin' the bitch
Then grab a hold of my dick, I pop a hole in ya click
See you don't wanna fuck with this
One nigga found on the ground, we don't fuck around
D-O-double G pound, L-B-C style


Victory is mine,and I'm gonna shine
Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep my pen in hand, going line from line
If you didn't know just press rewind, Victory is mine


Bang out, til the sun comes up 
The wheels fall off in the parking lot
Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me sleepin
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
Cause I bang out,shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass buck naked while you wit ya bitch
Cause I bang out


Eastside, Long Beach, rolling twenties
Yup, we fully wooded,
Yeah, we wear the black and gold coats
With patch on the back that says, "Steelers"
Bang out!
A lot niggas wanna do us but they can't
Cause it's hard to get wit us
Watch out for them sliders, boy we riders

We shoot first, talk later
Nigga, yaw paid her, doggy-dog sprayed her
Then I slid away, smooth little get-away

I gonna need a hit a day
I live my life like I was John F. Kenne-day

Twenty Crip, all day 



Bang out, til the sun comes up 
The wheels fall off in the parking lot
Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me sleepin
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
Cause I bang out,shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass buck naked while you wit ya bitch
Cause I bang out


Victory is mine,and I'm gonna shine
Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep my pen in hand, going line from line
If you didn't know just press rewind, Victory is mine
