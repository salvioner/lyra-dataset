Brad:  
The first Noel, the angels did say
Unto certain poor shephards in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Both:  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Ellen: 
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent
And follow that star wherever it went

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Brad:  
The star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
Both:  
And there it did most up and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
