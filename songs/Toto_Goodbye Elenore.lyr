I want to give her something she'll remember
And she say, "No, no, no, no, no"
I want to squeeze her tight and not offend her, yeah
She said, "No, no, no, no, no"
And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

I tried to tell the boys all about her, yeah
And they say, "No, no, no, no, no"
They told me she was loose, no doubt about her
Well I say, "No, no, no, no, no"
And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

Seems as though you've got your way before
You left me standing helpless just when I need more
You broke my heart for the last time; you broke my heart for the last time
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore

You broke my heart for the last time, broke my heart, it's the last time
You stole my heart and now you're gone forevermore
