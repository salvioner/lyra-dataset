Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week
The phone rings
And then you look at me

You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street
So why did 2-1-3
Show up on your caller ID?

I've been through all of this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around
And take some more

Things are gonna change
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here
For you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy
