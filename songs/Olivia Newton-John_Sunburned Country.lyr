I carry her with me
I carry her pride
Whenever I speak her name
My soul it comes alive

She taught me to be strong
She taught me to fight
And I am who I am today
Because she raised me right

Chorus: 
In a sunburned country
Her magic and her mystery
In a sunburned country
Forever will be home to me
Oh that's where my heart is truly free

The creeks and the rivers
The dust and the mud
All of us understand
This land gets in your blood

The sight of the blue gums
And black cockatoos
White snow Kosciusko
Red rock Uluru

In a sunburned country
Her magic and her mystery
In a sunburned country
Forever will be home to me
Oh that's where my heart is truly free

We've always been humble
Too scared to be proud
I think its time that
We all stand and say
We love our home out loud

In a sunburned country
Her magic and her mystery
In a sunburned country
Forever will be home to me
Oh that's where my heart is truly free

I love all the people
I love all the sounds
Sleeping under a tin roof
With a hard rain coming down
