I know the guy who we can blame
I even know his middle name
I never liked his stupid games

And if he tries to hunt us down
Or thinks that he can fool around
Well, we'll find him first and he will see
He'll never get to you or me
He'll never get to you or me

I know the guy who we can blame
He hasn't any sense of shame
He'll always be the stupid same

And if he tries to hunt us down
Or thinks that he can fool around
Well, we'll find him first and he will see
He'll never get to you or me
He'll never get to you or me

I know a guy who we can nail
I've drank with him, I've had his tail
We'll send him something in the mail

And if he tries to hunt us down
Or thinks that he can fool around
Well, we'll find him first and he will see
He'll never get to you or me
He'll never get to you or me
