Submission, my back hurts from bowing down
Attraction was once so strong, now can't be found
Affection, one gift I wish you would return
Frustration, as I accede

I do not deserve your frigidness
Such callousness, yet I persist
What's wrong with me?

I told you you can't be replaced
You showed me I'm disposable
Spit in my face as I submit
So I quit
