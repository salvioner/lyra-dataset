I took a walk down by the sea
And I listened to her strength
And I saw how tall I was
Realized how small I was
And I wonder...
Why the world should care for me?
I looked up into the swirling sky
Saw the clouds go rushing by
Realized how slow I was
And I saw how low I was
And I wondered....
Why the sun should shine for me?
