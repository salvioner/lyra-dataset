Oh, draw the blinds 
We can shut out the night 
Oh, pull up the blankets 
Pull the blankets up tight 

And there are angels on our curtains 
They keep the outside out 
And there are lions on our curtains 
They lick their wounds 
They lick their doubt 

We watch them float away
Along with our memories of the day
