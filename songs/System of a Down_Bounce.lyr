I went out on a date
With a girl, a bit late
She had so many friends
<i>(Gliding through many hands)</i>

I brought my pogo stick
Just to show her a trick
She had so many friends
<i>(Gliding through many hands)</i>

Unannounced Twister games
All players with no names
They lined up double quick
But just one pogo stick

Everyone gets to play
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non Ã¨ stata scritta
It was so exotic
But just one pogo stick
