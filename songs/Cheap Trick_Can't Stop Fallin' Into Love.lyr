Hey, little ladies
There's some cool young dude
Just standin' in line
And waitin' for you

There's a girl in the corner
With a jacked-up dress
She's got legs for miles
But her face looks a mess

There's always somethin' for everyone
But a love can be suicide, oh yeah
It's just what you've been waiting for
And I know it can't be denied, yeah

Can't stop fallin' into love
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of

Hey rock 'n rollers
What's happenin' with you
You've got the itch
And I've got it too

It's hard to be a winner every time
But I know you take it
You can make it all right

It's time that you just can't hide
But I can't control myself, oh, no, no
I know what you've been waitin' for
'Cause love can't be denied, yeah oo

Can't stop fallin' into love
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of

There's always somethin' for everyone
And I know what you mean in my eyes
I just can't control myself
And I fall for it every time, oh yeah

Can't stop falling into love, yeah
What's my heart been dreamin' up
No matter what I think or do or say, hey
I keep falling into love

I can't stop falling into love, yeah
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling into love
It's you, girl, I'm thinking of

I can't stop falling into love, ooo ooo
What's my heart been dreamin' up
No matter what I think or do or say, hey
I keep falling into love
