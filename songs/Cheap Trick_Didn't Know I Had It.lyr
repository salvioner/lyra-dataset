It was so easy that I started thinkin' somethin' had to change.
The gift of love was somethin' that I thought I'd go out and exchange.
I didn't realize how much you meant to me.
And now you're locked up with a brand new set of keys.
You said I might regret the day I let you go,
I'd wind up stranded like a washed up gigolo.
I'd get more static than a broken radio.
You were the right one all along...ooh.

'Cause I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.
I've been holdin' everything except for love,
I wish I had you back today.
Oh, I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.

Each day my hindsight just gets better, but I know that love is blind.

You were the only ray of sunshine I was ever gonna find.

You were the magic and I made you disappear.
Now I'd give everything I own to have you here.
You told me I was gonna make a big mistake,
I didn't know how many times my heart could break.
Now in the middle of the night, I'm still awake.
And all I can think of is you...ooh, ooh, ooh.

'Cause I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.
I've been holdin' everything except for love,
I wish I had you back today.
'Cause I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.

Now I know in my heart, I threw it away.
I've been holdin' onto everything except for love,
I wish I had you back today.
'Cause I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away...hey, hey.

You said that I'd regret the day I let you go.

I'd wind up stranded like some washed up gigolo.

I'd get more static than a broken radio.
You were the right one all along...ooh, ooh, ooh.

'Cause I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.
I've been holdin' everything except for love,
I wish I had you back today.
'Cause, I didn't know I had it,
'Til I threw it away.
No, I didn't know I had it...
'Til I threw it away.
