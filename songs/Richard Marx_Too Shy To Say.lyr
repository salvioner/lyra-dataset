You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good, everything

You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around

Chorus:
And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
I really love you

I wanna fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing left for us to do

I wanna be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end

Chorus x 2
