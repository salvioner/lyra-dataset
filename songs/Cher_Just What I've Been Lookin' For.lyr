You were told to wait there for love.
Love says it's waiting for you.
And all I want to say
is I know it's never easy
getting all dressed up with no place to go.
Help, for, that's what we're here for.
All one together.
Is no one alone
Come see your sister.
Call her your own.
Will no one hold you
We'll hold you.
