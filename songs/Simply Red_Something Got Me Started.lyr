Something got me started
You know that I will love you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you

I'd give it all up for you


Totally broken-hearted
Guilty of what I did to you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you

I'd give it all up for you


You've got to help me, help me, help me
