Leitch

We must be in harmony
Before we do anything
We must be in harmony
Before we move.

We must be in harmony
Before we do anything
We must be in harmony
Before me move.

Mistaken resistance can make you grieve
It can be plain-sailing if you believe.

We must be in harmony
Before we do anything
We must be in harmony
Before we move.

We must be in harmony
Before we do anything
We must be in harmony.
