Fuck 'em
Damn this shit sound low then motherfucker in my earphones
Alright, yeah, that's it right there nigga

As soon as the bass hits your dome
Snoop Dogg grabs the chrome and gets in your system
Shootin' off rhymes like a pistol
Fuckin' your click off with this blow
This hoe, that hoe make me rich
Snoop Dogg please won't you break that biach
I'm back in the game gettin' my dough
And fuck any motherfucker that say it ain't so
Do it to 'em be young
'Cause on the real dogg you the hardest nigga we um
We shakin' 'em off, breakin' 'em off
Shot him in his face and now they takin' him off

Here's a shoutout to those with quad out
Fool we should have got out, now you gettin' popped out
I'm not out to diss but to get my chips
And smash, pass with cash
And blaze the spliff now pass the fifth
For real nigga did you hear me? Ya heard?
You ran up you got served
Ain't that a trip? What? What?
You need to get up off of that bullshit, c'mon

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Young beast to four green
Dirty or clean nigga the money is all green
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cock it back ya know me
Every nigga look the same behind a stocking cap

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Shit on waisted
Rather see death then be locked down in metal bracelets
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Don't make a difference
Niggas in the hood is still broke and can't fix it
Fuck 'em

The scene is set
And it's a million bitch niggas 'bout to straight get wet
I walk 'em all in the street
Fuck 'em
I cuff they hands and blind they eyes and hog tie they feet
Fuck 'em
With no remorse nigga cut 'em down
Love the way we shut 'em down, shit it ain't funny now
Used to be my buddy, pal, nigga wet and bloody now
Nigga where your homies now, half them niggas funny style

Fuck 'em
It's 'bout to get shitty now
Doggy 'bout to get him now 'cause you better sit him down
Nigga, what up now? You act like a bitch
You bound to get fucked, you trick ass snitch
Fuck 'em
Boy we on a rampage
Rippin' up this damn stage, yeah, it's still a G thang
Slammin' doors, slappin' hoes
'Cuz fuck videos, I get a hundred for shows
If you ain't got the papers
I ain't got the time to sit and chat about the motherfucking vapors
Biach, don't even trip
You need to raise up off of that bullshit, c'mon

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Young beast to four green
Dirty or clean nigga the money is all green
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cock it back ya know me
Every nigga look the same behind a stocking cap

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Shit on waisted
Rather see death then be locked down in metal bracelets
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Don't make a difference
Niggas in the hood is still broke and can't fix it
Fuck 'em
