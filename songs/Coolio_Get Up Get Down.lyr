1: 
1 2 3 4 Get your woman on the floor 
Gotta gotta get up to get down 
Gotta gotta get up to get down 
What up everybody so glad you're here 
It's Coolio with the flow back in your ear 
This ain't a fantastic voyage 
But I'm still on a mission to see if I can 
Get your attention 
Now I want drops some information 
Just a little additive to your education 
I live my life by the code of the funk 
600 watt AMP. 18s in the trunk 
When I'm on the streets ya gotta feel my beats 
So throw your hands up if you're down with the C 
Double O-L-I-O with the flow 
I'm lookin' for the party so let a brother know 
1-2-3 it's like A-B-C if hip-hop didn't pay 
I'd rap for free 
2: 
Slide Slide but that's the past 
I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass 

If ya got beef then fool eat a pork chop 
Once I get it goin' ya know it don't stop 
I brake like anti-locks panties drop 
From hood to hood block to block 
Help I need somebody 
To get it goin' on in the party 
Baby you can do it take your time do it right 
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night 
My name ain't Wanda but I'll rock your world 
I get more bounce than a Jherry Curl 
Too many lookie-loos be lookin' for clues 
There's a party goin' on now whatcha gonna do 
So grab your partner do-see-do 
If you done know who it is it's Coolio 

Push, push in the bush 
But don't step on the toes 'cause you might get smushed 
It's the brother from around the way 
And what I say I'm in the corner on three like Dr. Dre 
Comin' at 'em with a pattern and a fresh pair adams 
I hope he don't trip, 'cause 
I don't wanna have to gat 'em 
So move your body, baby, drive the homies crazy 
Then when you sake that ass it's always amazin' 
Ain't no party like a west coast party 
'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
So when you see a young nigga 
In a Chevy hittin' switches 
Then ya gotta give a nigga his props 
I got sides in my rides and motion for your ocean 
Coolio got the potion to get the party open
