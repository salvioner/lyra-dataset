America

 loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking.)
We love you 
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the United States Government has sworn to uphold
Or so we are told
<i>(Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song)</i>

I never would have dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I've touched, so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who woulda thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some Peroxide reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this

I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keeps tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they sayin' I'm in trouble wit the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help


Lets do the math, if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

It's white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mutherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
Waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like I don't like yes no

All I hear is: Lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin' 
'Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say "faggot"
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the poster child
The mutherfuckin' spokesman now

For white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney!
Fuck you Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
Of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck You

Ha Ha Ha 
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
