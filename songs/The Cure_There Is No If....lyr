Remember the first time I told you I love you -
It was raining hard and you never heard -
You sneezed! and I had to say it over
'I said I love you,' I said... you didn't say a word
Just held your hands to my shining eyes
And I watched as the rain ran through your fingers
Held your hands to my shining eyes and smiled as you kissed me...

'If you die,' you said, 'so do I,' you said...
And it starts the day you make the sign
'Tell me I'm forever yours and you're forever mine
Forever mine...'

'If you die,' you said, 'So do I,' you said...
And it starts the day you cross that line
'Swear I will always be yours and you'll always be mine
You'll always be mine
Always be mine...'

Remember the last time I told you I love you -
It was warm and safe in our perfect world -
You yawned and I had to say it over
'I said I love you,' I said... you didn't say a word
Just held your hands to your shining eyes
And I watched as the tears ran through your fingers
Held your hands to your shining eyes and cried...

'If you die,' you said, 'So do I,' you said...
But it ends the day you see how it is
There is no always forever... just this...
Just this...

'If you die,' you said, 'So do I,' you said
But it ends the day you understand
There is no if... just and

There is no if... just and

There is no if...
