My my, my my oh give me love
My my, my my oh give me love
My my, my my give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
