I know that you don't love me 
I know you hate my guts 
I know the nasty things you say 
About me, to those sluts

Well, maybe I'm a weasel 
Maybe I'm a liar 
Maybe I'm a skinny punk 
Who couldn't change a tire

I'm laying down and I'm playing dead 
I ain't fetchin' no stick, no way, baby

I've always been this pasty 
I've always been this shape 
I'm just a teensy-weensy thing 
Passed on by itsy-bitsy apes

I'm laying down and I'm playing dead 
I ain't fetchin' no stick, no way, baby

You know that you could train me 
You know I'd sit and beg 
But you think I'm just a dirty dog 
That tried to hump that pretty leg

I'm laying down and I'm playing dead 
I ain't fetchin' no stick, no way, baby
