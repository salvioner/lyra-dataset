It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe

This is a love attack
I know it went out, but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out, and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?

Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound
Some, they fell down, and some got back up
And fought back 'gainst the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

It ain't no joke
When a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up
So choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't reform no god-like hocus-pocus

So don't sit back, kick back
And watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack, before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun
