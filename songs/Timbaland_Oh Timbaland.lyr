I ain't got no fillin'
I'm a let these niggas know
I been killin' 'em with these beats
Now I'm spittin' them killer flows
Whatcha know about me dog
Not damn thing
Gotta problem? You can see me in the streets dog
I'm a one man game
Don't take this lightly
If I want you dead and gone
I can make that happen because
Nigga, my bread is long
I done been on both sides of the tracks
You can say I trained the game
Alot of niggas tryin' to get in my lane
Everybody askin me the same ol' thing
What they say

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere

I ain't goin' nowhere dog
I'm a be right here in your face
Can't do it like me, dog
Your kick drum ain't got enough bass
Don't ever talk bad about me
You just might make me mad
And I just might see you somewhere
And break your ass 'N' half

This not the Timbaland you used to
Now I'm in a whole 'nother zone
You can let me do me
You can do you
Or get popped in ya door
Love on the verge to the block
So recognize the game
Timbaland ain't gonna run nowhere, baby
Timbaland got private planes

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere

I been around
Sometime long ago
I seen the life
Don't act like you ain't seen it before

I'm listenin', dog
You aint sayin shit
You can keep on wishin'
You never make a hit
Yeah, I got money
Take it all from me
I'm a gon be the same
You can get a few whips
You can get a few chips
You still gon' be a lame
We ain't the same, my nigga
I'm on some other shit
I'm a say this plain and simple
Nigga, take this punishment
I'm a take y'all on a trip
I'm a take y'all on a ride
And one day I'm gon' dip
But I won't be hard to find

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to

Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to
Nowhere
Oh, Timbaland
Where he gon' run to?
