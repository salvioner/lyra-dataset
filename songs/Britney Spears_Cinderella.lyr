I used to be your girlfriend
And I know I did it well
Oh yes, you know it's true
You called me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell
And I'd be there for you

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are, with nothin' but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for runnin' away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ahh, but Cinderella's got to go

From time to time I tried to tell
Just what was on my mind
You told me not today
Come back, do that
"Where's Cinderella at?"
Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are, with nothin' but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ahh, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

I used to say I want you
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to
But now I shall
Break free from all your lies
I won't be blind, you see
My love, it can't be sacrificed
I won't return to thee


I won't return to thee

I'm sorry to say I'm runnin' away now
Don't worry, you will be alright
I'm running away, I've made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go
'Cause she's got to go

I'm sorry for runnin' away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ahh, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go
