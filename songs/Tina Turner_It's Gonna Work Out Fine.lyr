Your lips set my soul on fire
You could be my one desire


I wanna tell you something ike
Ike, I went to see the preacher man



If your love is half as true as the love I offer you






I'm so glad that you're mine all mine



A whole lot of love just to be your speed
But now pretty daddy I'm all you need





I want you to know it's gonna work out fine
