You're mine and we belong together
Yes, we belong together, for eternity

You're mine, your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me, for eternity

You're mine, my baby and you'll always be
I swear by everything I own
You'll always, always be mine

You're mine and, we belong together
Yes, we belong together, for eternity
