Let's get bloooooowwwnnnn.. let's get blooooooowwwnnnn..


Looking at the ladies, all of them fly
I don't know which one I want dawg
I can't make up my mind, girl
So won't you make it easy on me?
Take this drink, then hit this weed
Two step wit me, let's slip to the dance floor
On and on and on and on we go
I'll dip you if you want me to
You see I really wanna get a little front wit you, bigidy bump wit you
A nigga wanna hump you and then just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top and lay you on the cot, and get you nice and hot
Yeah yeah, it's all to the real
We could do it like Guy, c'mon girl "Let's Chill"




Now you can fly the friendly skies
With the S-N double O-P D-O double G-Y
Now don't ask why, just keep looking good in the hood
Damn girl, you so fly! We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize or was is it Malibu? It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a hoe
She kept telling me Doggy Dogg I gotta go
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend
2 plus 2, it equals 4, this is some shit that could last forever more
I'm trying to put my bid in, naw I'm just kidding
Come on ma get in, and don't ask where we going
Pimping and hoeing, drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it c'mon!




I've been looking at you, from the corner of my eyes
Checking out your hips, lips, tits and your thighs
I've been wanting to do you, for a mighty long time
You make a pimp wanna sing I - I - I
We'll head to the hills, your dreams I'll fulfill
We could do it how you want, cause I'm oh so real
Tell me you, naw I won't squeal
You wit Da Big Bo$$ Dogg so seal the deal
Pharrell got the Babyface and Dogg got the Whip Appeal, so name the place
This love I bring to you, on the real baby girl
Won't you do me a favor and sing for Snoop









Can I get my thrills? .. Can I get my thrills?
