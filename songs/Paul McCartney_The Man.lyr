There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
There's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell, ooh

And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks, then rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs and kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
Ooh, there's such a man
He's not like me and you
And it's just the way she thought it would be, ooh

As he says, something has happened to me
And he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
And he laughs, as he smiles and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

Did you know this man can do anything?
Ooh, there's such a man
I wish that we could bring, ooh
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

This is the man <i>(this is the man)</i>
This is the man <i>(this is the man)</i>
This is The Man
