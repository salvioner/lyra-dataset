Well she said goodbye, to her man,
She missed the ship even though she ran,
And she rowed, ah didn't she row.
Yeah she had to sail, across the sea,

So she booked a trip on an old ferry,
And she rowed, ah didn't she row.
Well the captain saw the girl on to the quay,
But he still sailed away,

There were no more boats for another week,
And she had no place to stay.
Yeah her man had gone, she din't know were,
so she stole a dinghy from a yacht somewhere,

And she rowed, ah didn't she row.
The sea was rough, the weather was bad,
But she kept on rowing 'till she got to France,
And she rowed, ah didn't she row.

Well she travelled so fast caused such a stir,
The people came from miles around,
To see the girl who stole a boat,
When she missed her ship in town.
