This is my rap song
1-2-3-4
I'm gettin really sick and tired
Of these boys up in my face
Pick-up lines like what's your sign?
Won't get you anyplace
When me and all my girls
Go walking down the street
It seems we can't go anywhere
Without a car that goes beep, beep        :::BEEP BEEP:::

'Cause this body is a priceless piece
Of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?

Hey ladies, yeah?
Let 'em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Let's come together
Hey Sistas, yeah?
Its time to be greedy


Mirror, mirror on the wall
Damn, I sure look fine
I can't blame those horny boys
I'd would make me mine
When I pass you in a club
"Ooh la la," you gasp
Back up boy, I ain't your toy
Or your piece of ass!

'Cause this body is a priceless piece
Of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?
No no no

Hey ladies, yeah?
Let 'em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Let's come together
Hey Sistas, yeah?
Its time to be greedy
Nothin' good comes for free X2
Nothin' good comes for free

No jealousy, no envy girls
Come on let's work it out
No freebies in the limousine
That's not what it's about
Let him know there's work to do
Give it up, he won't call you
Respect is just a minimum
Go on girl and get you some

1-2-3-4
Hey ladies, yeah?
Let em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Let's come together
Sistas, yeah?
Its time to be greedy
Nothin' good comes for free X2

Let's come together
Come on girls lets work it out
Let's come together
Let's show 'em what it's all about
Let's come together
Let's come together
Let's come together
Let's come together
You gotta let 'em know
That it ain't easy street, no
