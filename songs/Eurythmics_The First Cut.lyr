The first cut - is a criminal thing
The first cut - goes deeper in
Each impression
Makes a chain reaction
Each impression
Will never be never be never be broken

I'm a white girl - you can see my skin
Look at this picture - that I 'm living in
And old scores
Never settle down
I'll keep on walking
Till I'm burried in the cold ground
Cold ground
Cold cold ground
