When I was a young boy I lived for rock 'n' roll
We spent our time playing gigs and traveling on the road
And we didn't have much money and the gigs were sometimes rough
But playing music for the people seemed to be enough
And the music is so sweet that it makes me tap my feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost touch the sky

Now I am a young man dressed in sparkling coloured clothes
A country house and sixty acres are a heavy load
We still have no money but we have some nice things
Possession is, possessions are the trait that money brings
And the snowflakes are so sweet as they fall around our feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost feel the sky

Now I am an old man, I know exactly what to do
Never ask a question or ever give an answer to you
And when you pass me by and you drop a penny in my hat
Don't feel sorry on my account 'cause life can be like that
And the music is so sweet that it makes me tap my feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost feel the sky
And the river rolls along like a never ever ending song
And the river rolls along like a never ever ending song
