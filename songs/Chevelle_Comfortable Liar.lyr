Broad is this sea
The salt enters the wound

My take on you is simple

So heal your fear
To heal your fear

Time spent waking off shore
The calm before the storm

My take from you is simple

So heal your fear
To heal your fear

You're such a comfortable liar

So come

'Cause I said wrong

You comfortable liar

Liar
