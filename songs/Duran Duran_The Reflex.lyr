You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh whoa
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh whoa

Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is an only child
He's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and I wanna get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it



Why-y-y-y-y don't you use it?

The reflex is an only child
He's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves an answer with a question mark

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is an only child
He's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves me answered with a question mark

Ah, the reflex, what a game
He's hiding all the cards
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
