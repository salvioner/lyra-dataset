Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't

You're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable
Cause you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable

All it takes is just one more lie
One more small indiscretion
I don't wanna hear your alibi
I don't wanna hear your confession
You know I love you
But don't forget it's true

That you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable
Cause you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable
Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh
Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh

Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't

So many try to hold my hand
Try hard just to be a part of me
But you act with your single plan
So why shouldn't I take my heart with me
You know I love you
But don't forget it's true

That you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable
Cause you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable

Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh
Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh

Cause right now you are walking on dangerous ground
This could be over if you keep playing around
I'm keeping it ice, i'm keeping it diamond, keeping it crystal clear

You are inter-changeable
Baby it's unmistakeable

You're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable
Cause you're replaceable, replaceable
So don't you ever ever get too comfortable

Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh
Cause I could easily easily easily
Oh so easily easily easily change you
Ohh

Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
Don't think I won't
