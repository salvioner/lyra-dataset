Motor cars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, Army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard

Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me

Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard
