If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

Ba-ba-ba-bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

Bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

It's like 1, 2, 3, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron
I don't give a fuck about goin' home

Straight buzzin', Robitussin
Wanna get your mitts in my oven?
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin'

Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

Bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low


Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low



Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

It's like 1, 2, 3, okay
Can I get a little Goose in my O.J.?
E'rey day feel like my birthday
And we sip champagne when we thirsty

Quit fightin' while your husband
Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin'

Yeah, I like it loud
And I make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

Ba-ba-bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low


Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low


Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low

I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
Do you like it when I flow?
With my bass down low

It's like la la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know


Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low


Ba-ba-bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low

I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
