Sometimes it's hard to express what you feel
While trying to say the things that are real
I don't wanna fight for fighting just brings pain
Just wanna hold you in my loving arms again

Let me see the sunrise shining in your eyes
Taste the winds and feel blue skies
I've heard all I can tell all your troubles and strife
Let me make something Let me make something in your life
Sometimes I catch myself talking loud
While others I get lost in a crowd
Then all my thoughts is being scared and get lost
Cause I paid for my freedom too high a cost



I've been so lonely and I've been so blue
Now without you, there's nothing I can do
Why can't we try and make amends? 
We used to be good friends, why? 
I don't want to lose you
We don't have to say goodbye.
