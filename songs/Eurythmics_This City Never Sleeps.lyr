You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder

You know there's so many people
Living in this house
And don't even know their names

I guess it's just a feeling - in the city

Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating

I guess it's just a feeling - in the city
