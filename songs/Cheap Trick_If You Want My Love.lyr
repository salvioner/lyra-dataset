If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, oooh!

If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, oooh!

Yes, I thought you were a mystery girl
A special girl in this crazy old world
You couldn't see me when I laid eyes on you

Lonely is only a place
You don't know what it's like
You can't fight it
It's a hole in my heart, in my heart

If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, oooh!

Ahaha...

You hold the secrets of love in this world
I'm hypnotized by your every word
A special face, a special voice
A special smile in my life

'Cause lonely is only a place
You don't know what it's like
You can't fight it
And it's a hole in my heart, in my heart

If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, oooh!

If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, oooh!

If you want my love you got it
When you need my love you got it
You won't hide it
You won't throw your love away, oooh!
