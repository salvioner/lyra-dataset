Bad word
Or bad deed
Unpunished invites grief
Here's
Rawhead and Bloodybones

Reaching from
Dark cupboard
Crouching under stair,
Lurking in chimney
Pond or well

We're down here
Held here
Dragged here
And drowned here by
Rawhead and Bloodybones

Pop-eyed
Horns
Bushy-tailed
Long teeth and
Claws as well

Rawhead and Bloodybones
