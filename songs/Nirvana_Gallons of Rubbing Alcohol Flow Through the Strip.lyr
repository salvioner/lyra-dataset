It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow

She's only been five months late, even though we haven't had sex for a week

A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made my 

Somebody else already used the word 'aurora-borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer

She's only five weeks late, but I haven't had a date forever 
Ever, ever, forever!

Wish I had more, more opportunity,
More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my 
On my, on my, um, ah, on my, um, um, head

We'd have so much more diversity,
And so much more input, so much more creative flow,
If we had someone in school, a GIT

GIT, geeks in town
Ha!
Come on, Dave, think of one!
Girls with trouble
It should be GIC, geeks with charvels
No, GWC, fuck man this is a waste of time 

One more solo?  
Yeah! Yeah!

You're personally responsible for 
The entire strip to be washed away 
Cleansed as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire.

It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom,
And his silk
And he, he erected a beautiful city 
A city of stars
 stars
