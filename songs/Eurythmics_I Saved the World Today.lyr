Monday finds you like a bomb
It's been left ticking there too long
You're bleeding
Some days there's nothing left to learn
From the point of no return
You're leaving

Hey hey I saved the world today
Everybody's happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybody's happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay

There's a millions mouths to feed
But I've got everything I need
I'm breathing
And there's a hurting thing inside
But I've got everything to hide
I'm grieving

Hey hey I saved the world today
Everybody's happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybody happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay

Doo doo doo doo doo the good thing

Hey hey I saved the world today
Everybody's happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybody happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay
Everybody's happy now
