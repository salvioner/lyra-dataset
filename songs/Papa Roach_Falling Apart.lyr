<i>I'll follow you, out of the dark
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart</i>

All that I see is the wickedness around me
I refuse to believe the apocalypse inside of me
I can't even trust myself, I'm burning in my skin
Standing at the gates of Hell but nobody will let me in

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart
I'll follow you with all my heart
I'm tired of my ways, 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart

I stand here again, forsaken in a place that feels like I can never win
I'm reaching for a saving grace
I can't even trust no-one, I need to rise above
I don't think I'm good enough to feel your perfect love

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart
I'll follow you with all my heart
I'm tired of my ways, 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart
I'm falling, I'm falling apart
I'm falling, I'm falling apart
I'm falling apart

Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy, I'm covered in it
I fall hard and you carry me
I fall apart so you can set me free

Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy, I'm covered in it
I fall hard and you carry me
I fall apart so you can set me free

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart

I'll follow you with all my heart
I'm tired of my ways, 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart
I'm falling, I'm falling apart
Without you I'm falling apart
I'm falling, I'm falling apart
