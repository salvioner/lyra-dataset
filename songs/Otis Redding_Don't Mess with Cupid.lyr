You must have thought my love was for fun
You tried to spend it like a dollar
You got the right string, baby
But your yo-yo is the wrong color

Don't you mess with Cupid
Cupid, he's not stupid
Don't you mess with Cupid
Cupid, he's not stupid

You thought my love was just a rug on the floor
Just to walk on and nothing more
You just don't seem to understand

Don't you mess with Cupid
Cupid, he's not stupid
Don't you mess with Cupid
Cupid, he's not stupid

When I look for you, you're never home
Like a lamp, you turn me off and on
But like a shade that dims the light
When it's opened, I can't do nothing right
I'm warning you, baby
Don't you mess with this Cupid
Baby, he's not stupid
