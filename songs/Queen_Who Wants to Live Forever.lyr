There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooooooo

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment 
Set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooooooo


When love must die

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Who waits forever anyway?
