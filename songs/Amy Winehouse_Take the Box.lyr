Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you

Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it take the box
And now just take the box, take the box
