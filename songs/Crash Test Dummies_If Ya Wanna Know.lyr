I never realized how much I prized you

I never thought you'd do me just one time 

And if I could again lay eyes upon on you

I know I'd make you want me one more time



The days are long, the nights are hot without you

I put your picture right beside my bed

When I run out of things for me to do to you 

I do them all again inside my head



And if you wanna know what I wanna do

Just ask me, I'll show you

And if you think you know what I wanna do

Don't ask me, I'll trust you



I'll bend upon my knees to help you, baby

I wanna make it easy for you too 

And when I finally get to please you, baby

You'll want to take your turn and try me too



And if you wanna know what I wanna do

Just ask me, I'll show you

And if you think you know what I wanna do

Don't ask me, I'll trust you



I watch at night, I've trained my sights right on you

and I won't let you get away next time 

and when I finally get my hands upon you

I know I'll make you want me one more time



And if you wanna know what I wanna do

Just ask me, I'll show you

And if you think you know what I wanna do

Don't ask me, I'll trust you
