You walked in the room 
First I saw your face, then I saw your smile
A pretty girl like yourself 
You've got a new approach and the time is right 
You think you're so fine, oh so fine
And it so excites me
Come six with my nine 
You're my perfect partner and the time is getting right

Take me I'm yours, take me I'm yours
Come on now and take me
Take me amour, take me I'm yours
Come on now and take me

Oh, don't you be so nice to me
Oh, you can't be serious
A pretty girl like yourself
You'll be my perfect partner and the time is getting right

Take me I'm yours, take me I'm yours
Come on now and take me
Take me amour, take me I'm yours
Come on, now, and take me

I love the way you wear your hair
I saw the way you stopped and stared
When I looked at you, oh no, oh no
Well maybe girls like you aren't free
But baby, baby can't you see
I just want to be with you

You walked through the room
Continental style and sweet perfume
A pretty girl like yourself
You've got a new approach and the time is getting right

Take me I'm yours, take me I'm yours
Come on now and take me
Take me amour, take me amour
Come on, now, and take me
Take me
