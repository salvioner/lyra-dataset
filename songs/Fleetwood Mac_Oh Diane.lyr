Oh no, here I go again
Fallin' in love again

Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand
Oh, oh, whoa...
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane

Will I love you, I will, always
Will you stand by me always

'Cause Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand
Oh, oh, whoa...
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane

Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane

Oh, oh, Diane
