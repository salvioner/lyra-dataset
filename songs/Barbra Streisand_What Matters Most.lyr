It's not how long we held each other's hands
What matters is how well we loved each other
It's not how far we've traveled on our way
But what we found to say
It's not the springs we've see
But all the shades of green

It's not how long I held you in my arms
What matters is how sweet the years together
It's not how many summertimes
We have to give to fall
The early morning smiles
We wistfully recall
What matters most is that we loved at all

It's not how many summertimes
We have to give to fall
The laughter and the tears
We gratefully recall
What matters most is that we loved at all
