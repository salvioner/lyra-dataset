One more night
One more night

I've been trying for so long, to let you know,
let you know how I feel
So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,
so I can make you see

Please give me one more night,
give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long, just wasting time,
just staring at the phone
And always wondering, should I call you,
then I thought, but maybe you're not alone

Oh please give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
One more night, 
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
One more night, 
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Like a river to the sea,
I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

To give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I know there'll never be a time
you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Ah give me just one more night,
give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
oh give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
it forever
