Girl, I got to go

I got to go now, really
Yeah, I'm kinda in a hurry

Uh-huh, here's the reason why

Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it


Jump, jump, jump to it





My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact

There is no fighting
Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane

I can't talk to you now, girl, I got love to get
When my baby calls I got jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it


I just can't wait till
Today at four
That's when my sweet thing
Said he would call

Please don't keep me waitin'
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh, come please be mine

Girl, I can't talk to you now, I got love to give
When my baby calls I got jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump, to it

Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it


Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it



You know when we talk we have a lot of fun, don't we, girl
Dishin' out the dirt on everybody
And givin' each other the 411 on who drop kicked who this week
