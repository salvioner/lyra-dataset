 Good evening ladies and gentleman
 We like to thank yall for coming out tonight
 

 This ones for you for you for you for you for you
 

 I'm blowin good yea I smoke it by tha zone
 And when them niggas call I don't pick up my phone
 Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
 I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
 Yea this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas
 Yea I'm talkinn bout them fuck niggas fuck niggas
 Yea this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas 
Yea I'm talkinn bout them fuck niggas fuck niggas
 This ones for you
 

 I'm high southwest jizzle when your flight land
 I don't know bitch I might fly to england
 Hit tha highway with tha change yea tha change man
 I done it my way with them thangs change tha game plan
 Had these niggas tellin lies they just sound true
 Nigga if you had it like that nigga I would of found you
 I'm tryin to cash out a hunned lemme get a buck
 Must of been just like you nigga fake as fuck
 Getem home and they probably all sheet rock
 They sellin bullshit fuckinn up tha street stock
 You livinn mine and yours that's a double dip
 That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip
 And nigga nuthinn beat tha cross but tha double cross
 I ran tha streets and rap bitch ima double boss
 Tha nigga cashed out once I sent tha double off
 They knocked em off half way I took a double loss
 

 

 Lets put these niggas on tha stand 
Now stand up and be a man 
Raise your hand and swear you were ma number one fan
 And I'm still that same nigga you still that same nigga
 But at tha same time I'm startinn to get bad vibes
 What I owe you sumthinn nigga thats what you act like
 Ain't like them other niggas boy you better act right
 Tha first two years of your deal ride ya traininn wheels
 And then you graduated and lived how real niggas lived
 And I ain't dissin naw I ain't dissin
 But when you sit back an listen 
This what tha rap game is missin
 I'm used to thug niggas
 Its to many young niggas with
 Too much liquor too many drugs in em
 Too many cliqs too much swag now
 Too many niggas swearinn tight shirts and skinnys
 Walked around with they ass out
 Yall better cash out
 Gone put yo cash up
 Cause I'm all in if I don't win
 Nigga ima mask up
 

 

 Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role
 Errbody wanna ride tha train but don't wanna pay tha toll
 Keep it going young boy you on a roll
 Hoe nigga magazine you tha center fold
 U can check tha resume nigga I'm good as gold
 Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold
 Nigga you talkin with emotion you emotional
 U might can get a lil light feelin promotional
 Tell me what you see when you lookin ina mirror
 Look at this hoeass nigga I couldn't said it clearer
 And you tha same nigga started up this jewelry game
 And when you see him nowaday that nigga jewelry lame
 Ain't got it by now nigga you ain't got it
 And nigga why you talkin like that cause bitch you ain't bout it
 And nigga how you doin now worst than before
 And bitch we winning over here I'm be keeping score
