Well the key to my survival 
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane 
Trying to find the way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it 
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear every day 
Of what might happen that night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying 
Of my mother, and I remember when 
I swore that, that would be the last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
Well, he sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said, you're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it 
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go, and what should I do
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help, oh I came here for you

Well the years, they passed so slowly
I thought about him every day
What would I do if we passed on the street?
Would I keep running away?
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
But I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
And he looked me straight in the eyes
He said, you're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
When you walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go, and what should I do
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help, oh I was looking for you

You're no son, you're no son of mine, oh
You're no son, ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah
You're no son, you're no son of mine, oh, oh
