Come with me, come with me,
To the carnival, to the carnival.

You will see, you will see,
What you want to see, exactly what you want to be,
At the carnival, at the carnival, at the carnival.

Come with me, come with me,
To the carnival, to the carnival,
To the carnival, to the carnival, to the carnival.

Come with me, come with me.
Come with me, come with me.
