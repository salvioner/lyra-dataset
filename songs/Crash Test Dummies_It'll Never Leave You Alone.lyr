I think I'll have just one

Well, maybe just another one

Of course the third one's so much fun



It'll never leave you alone

And if you try and tell it to go

You'll just turn around

And bring it right back home



I think I'll have a puff

One should be enough

It shouldn't have to be that tough



It'll never leave you alone

And if you try and tell it to go

You'll just turn around

And bring it right back home



I think it's time for a sniff

Just a little teensy whiff

My head is howling and my bones are stiff -

So would you like a hit?

Just a little teensy-weensy bit?

I think you're gonna like it



It'll never leave you alone

And if you try and tell it to go

You'll just turn around

And bring it right back home
