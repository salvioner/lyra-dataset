Friday
She found out

The party needs to cool a little dream didn't do it
Never got it back from you
Drive away
You can bring a fool remember
You can ride away
Never gonna get back there

There's red light in the moonlight baby
That's all, I'm moving on from you
You can try to leave me or doubt me
Oh I'm the coolest still, right now

I'd never say goodbye little baby
Never again
