Different eyes with the same old screen
We laugh, we love, we cry from what we've seen
It's crazy, it's how we feel
We're staring at the walls and living out of magazines
Ooh, ooh, cryin' outside the line
There's people with disease

If you took a chance, would you like to dance
'Cause my heart is cryin'
What it would mean to me
It's like make-believe
And my heart is cryin', cryin'
Can't you see my heart is cryin'

Different minds with the same old dreams
We live a life of imaginary means
It's crazy, it's how we feel
A pilot always tries to fly without a winning pace
A runner can never decide to end a given race
Staring outside, a child's made a big mistake

If you took a chance, would you like to dance
'Cause my heart is cryin'
What it would mean to me
It's like make-believe
And my heart is cryin', my heart is cryin'
My heart is cryin'
Can't you see my heart is cryin'

Different minds with the same old dreams
We live a life of imaginary means
Ooh, ooh, cryin' outside the line
There's people with disease

If you took a chance, would you like to dance
'Cause my heart is cryin'
What it would mean to me
It's like make-believe
And my heart is cryin', my heart is cryin'
My heart is cryin'
