Well she's walking through the clouds 
With a circus mind that's running round 
Butterflies and zebras 
And moonbeams and fairy tales 
That's all she ever thinks about 
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad, she comes to me 
With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free 
It's alright she says it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything 
Anything

Fly on little wing, 
Yeah yeah, yeah, little wing
