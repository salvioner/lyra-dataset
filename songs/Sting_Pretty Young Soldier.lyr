There are two young lovers, they're pledged to each other's hands
They meet by the river, to talk of their marriage plans
"I'm confessing," he said, "I've signed for a soldier
And I'm leaving tomorrow for some foreign land"

She watches the pretty young soldiers
As they march themselves off to the war
She wonders if she'll ever see him again
Somehow she doubts it, but she has to be sure

So she rode into town on the very next day
And dressed herself up all in man's array
With a sword and a musket she took the King's shilling
And to fight in some foreign war
She said, "Yes!," she'd be willing

All you pretty young soldiers
In those uniforms that you've never worn
The Captain will come to inspect you all now
"Let me down and you'll all wish you'd never been born"

The Captain astride of his horse's grey flanks
Pulls the pretty young soldier from out of the ranks
His gaze it is fixed and she's starting to shake
He said, "Follow me soldier and listen to the offer that I'm willing to make"

"Come you pretty young soldier
Come and be my right hand
You're having this strange effect on my soul
That I don't quite understand"

"Captain, oh Captain, I've a confession to make
I love someone else and my heart it will break"
And as she released her brown hair from a band
It tumbled all down her shoulders and into his hands

"Oh you pretty young soldier
Come and take my right hand
You're having this strange effect on my soul
And now I think, I understand"
