Juliet, you're my love I know it's true
Around you I don't know what to do
Can't you see that you're my sun and moon
Juliet, once upon a time is not enough
Don't you know that I'm a man in love
And I can't get enough of you

Your window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you're still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you'll be my, be my juliet

Juliet, every single time you get me all messed up
I try to talk it out
But you're so hot to touch
And juliet, I feel so dangerous
Looking in your eyes is perilous
But I don't care 'cause I would die for love

Your window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you're still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you'll be my, be my

Juliet, you are a drug and it is quick
And with a kiss I lose my senses
Juliet, you are a fire, I am consumed
Tonight I'm dying in your arms

Through window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you're still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you'll be my, be my juliet

Juliet
Romeo and juliet
