You the it girl, hey hey
My inspiration
My compass spinnin', baby
It's the right destination

Oh, come on, come on
Give me what I came for
I got treasure to hide
So let's keep it from the strangers

Your waves, they wash all over me
Your tides, they pull me back to sea <i>(back to sea)</i>
When you bite on my lip
And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
When you kiss on my lips
And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
 
You don't know, I've been missin' you
Baby when you, go
..only way...

And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
When you kiss on my lips
And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
 
You don't know, I've been missin' you
Baby when you, go, I been missin' you
Truly gettin' me high, I be missin' you
You make me down right seasick
Oh the only way you can...
