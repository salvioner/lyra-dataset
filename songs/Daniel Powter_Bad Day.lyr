Where is the moment when we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

<i>(A holiday)</i>
You had a bad day
<i>(A holiday)</i>
You had a bad day
<i>(A holiday)</i>
You had a bad day
