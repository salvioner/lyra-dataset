Hard-working Mr. Dynamite




Yo, I don't mean to brag, there's the tag
Brown got a brand new bag
Shining star up to par
Bars guitars
So far so good, gettin' greater at last
Where it counts, later for the last
First you're dead and stinkin'
Thinkin', winkin', drinkin', sinkin'
Ba-ba-ba-blinkin'
Baby paw, New York City is in the house
Without a doubt, we turn the mutha out
Routs threw out shouts, "Ain't we funky now"
Godfather, Soul Brother Number One



I'm hot, huh!
90 are levels of degrees burnin
Turnin' in a rough rotation
Livin' in the land of the lost and found
Can't drown in sounds of the James Brown, Brown, Brown
This is the mixture when you add hard texture
Can't get no harder, so I'm out to getcha
Its essence felt, you're turned inside out
Fellas, what you gon' say now?
Thirsty? Not, my verse just quenched your thirst
From the burst of energy
Shinin' on the appetite
Can't cross the thin line of the end of my time

Pop or not, I come to break up slots
'Cause it can't get no harder
Give it to me, Godfather


Can't get any harder, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, 'cause what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Hey!

I've been around for a long time
Won't let nobody bring me down
Rock solid, solid as a rock
Too smooth to move and too hard to stop


Oh yes, come and get with this entourage
As we get busy in the garage
Leaders of the New forever large
'Cause we got the funk flip script, oh yes
Get up and ill, everybody move your hip, scream out "Yes!"
That's what I'm talkin about, ah!
Busta, Leaders come and turn it out
Don't try to front on the flavor
Save that for later
Or join the Maker in the spirit like an elevator
You want to know somethin' funny? I was devasted
When I elaborated how we collaborated
With singers in music activated
Most necessary that we salute many too livin' legendary
James Brown comin to you, better open the door
Because I want to mop the floor!


Do it, ya
Gimme some rap, now hah
Put it there
Welcome to the club
Huh!
Bring it all together

Can't get any harder, ugh, than what I got

'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, ah, good God, than what I got

'Cause what I got, aaaaeeew, is sho' nuff hard to stop

I've been around for a long time
Won't let nobody bring me down
Rock solid, solid as a rock
Too smooth to move and too hard to stop
Can't get any harder
Ugh!
Agh!
Move-a
Aaaaaaooooh yes-a!

Aaaaaaaw!
The groove move ya

Can't get any harder, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, good God, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop


Brown!
