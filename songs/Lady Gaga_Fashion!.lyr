I take it off, I put it on
I feel alive, when I transform
But this love's not material
Now take it in, and turn me on
Zip me up, it can't be wrong
'Cause your new look's ethereal
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
