Take that look of worry, I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing, so I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning right outside my door
I can't see, but I feel it, and it helps to keep me warm

So I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waiting, still don't know what for
There's no point escaping, I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you, I don't like to go outside
They can't turn off my feelings, like they're turning off the light

But I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

So take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember,
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can say to you

Take that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight and sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons, I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen, ah but I know who they are

And I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

So take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - oh Lord

Well I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can say to you
But I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home - 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
