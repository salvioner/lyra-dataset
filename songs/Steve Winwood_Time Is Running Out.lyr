Every day there's something new that's going around
Crazy people getting all dressed up to paint the town
Business men they shake their heads and then they frown
Everybody tries so hard to put them down

It seems to me that maybe they got something going
And if you don't make an effort, then you got no way to know
Time is running out

Woman, can you hear me clear?
I hope that you can
Before you go to sleep at night
Take care of your man

And if you want a love that will always be around forever
Then you finally get it, ah, but you ain't gonna have it together

Time is running out, running out
Time is running out, running out

Johnny drives a Thunderbird, he's in a big rage
Always being criticized for being his age
In his nose a safety pin and life's a razor blade
He's so sick of everything that's been made

It seems to me that maybe he's got bad frustration
And all we can do is try and give the right information
Oh, 'cause time is running out

Population on the move
So don't you delay
Get yourself right in the groove
'N' hear what I say
It's no good being lazy
You've got to get up on your feet and shout
'Cause it'll make you crazy
When you realise you've been left out

Time is running out, running out
Time is running out, running out
Time is running out, running out

In the future there's no room 
People standing on your toes
Mother nature's on the run 
Everybody's got a gun

Soldiers walking in the street
Giving off a lot of heat
There just ain't enough to eat
If you're poor, you've got no meat

Advertising in the sky
They like to stick it in your eye
So mad it will make you cry
All the things that you don't need





Time is running out, running out
Time is running out, running out






Take me where the air is clean 
To the country, fresh and green
I just cannot stand this pace
Sorry, but there's no such place

Time is running out, running out...
