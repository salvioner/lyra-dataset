Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more and more,
Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back,
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back,
So captivating when I get it on the floor.

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror,
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner.
That's when under pressure with seconds left I show up.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

Get out both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
But I'm in the area, if you more and more,
Cause I can't wait to feel it.
I go hard, can't stop,
But if I stop it then just know that imma bring it back,
Never quittin'; don't believe in that.

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror,
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner.
That's when under pressure with seconds left I show up.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire,
And light it up, take it up higher,
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.

Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.
