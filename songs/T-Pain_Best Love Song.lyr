Turn up the bass, turn up the treble, 
I'm about to take you to a whole other level! 
DJ turn off what you're playing
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying! 
Because this girl means so much to me, 
And now we're on the floor and she touching me. 
And if I wanna take her home 
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio! 
Hi, you crazy boy

It's gotta be the crunkest 
It's gotta be the loudest 
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smiling, 
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby 
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like that 

Turn up the lights, give me a mic 
I'm bout to sing it to her just how she likes. 
Jump off the stage bombs away,
Crowd surfin all the way, Cowabunga! 
You know it's right, just do the wave, 
Girl just move your body like a snake 
And if you wanna get with me 
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy 

It's gotta be the crunkest 
It's gotta be the loudest 
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smiling, 
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby 
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like that 

Homie kiss your girl 
Shorty kiss your man 
We can see you on the kissin cam 
Now show me some love 
Show me some love 
Now look her in the eye, say baby I love you 
I never put no one above you 
And if you feel that way 
Go ahead and kiss your baby 
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like that 
And if you feel that way 
Go ahead and kiss your baby 
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like that 
Eh, eh, eh, eh 
Oh, oh, oh
 oh
