I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth

I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you

'Cause without you beside me, I can't survive
I don't want to try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you, oh

See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess
It shows that we were destined to shine

It took the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

You
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found you
