Oboe concerto
All the best ones are dead
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

Oboe concerto
All I do is drink to absent friends
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

The older generation have tried, sighed & died
Which pushes me to their place in the queue

Round, rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
