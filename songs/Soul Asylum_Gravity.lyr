There's a little old man, who can get his hands
On a brand new silver planet
Walks the walk, and he talks the talk
If I had the world he could have it

For every question there are ways to shoot it down
Well there's a greenback, a green light
So we suggest we get this new thing off the ground

But I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it
The way you handled it, I got to hand it to you
No I can't stand the gravity, understand it
The way you handled it, I'm coming out of my shoes

Shudder, and wind me up
Like a toy on my first day of school
Stranded, abandoned
It's the rent and I'm out of food

For every answer there are questions to spare
It's nothing but convenience though it's not convenient
We ain't going anywhere

But I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it
The way you handled it, I come and hand it to you
But I can't stand the gravity, understand it
The way you handled it, I'm coming out of my shoes

Come on home
Drifting up alone
Burning away
Up in the space

Lie down in a dream
Tell me whatcha need
Just a circuitry
It's only sanctity
Live how you wanna live

Circle like a satellite
Like a shooting star, still flickering, still glowing
The room is still on fire

For every answer there are ways to shoot it down
Down on the cold ground do you believe that this time you are comin' round

But I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it
The way you handled it, I come and hand it to you
No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it
The way you handled it, I'm coming out of my shoes

Lie down in a dream
Tell me whatcha need
It's only sanctity
Just a circuitry
Live how you wanna live
Like a Shooting star
Like candle light, still flickering
Floating like a bumble bee, in a whirlwind, blowing
Like a candle light
Starting to disintegrate
