We go back a long long way 
And it seems like yesterdaay 
When the words are spoken 
Or whispered in your ear
Things have changed since we first met 
You alone are more than I expect 
But the good outweighs the bad 
By 110 per cent
You take me to the top 
You're everything I've got 
You catch me if I'm falling 
Oh all the way 
You take me to the top 
You catch me if I'm falling oh
Some things go in circles 
Something's in the air 
You know just what I'm feeling 
You can make the difference 
You know I really care
You take me to the top 
You're everything I've got 
You catch me if I'm falling Oh all the way 
You take me to the top 
You catch me if I'm falling 
Oh ah ah Oh
If I could dream a dream 
With a happy end 
You'd be in it every night 
Again and again 
Right here by my side 
You'd never go away 
But I'm awake 
I sing I say
You take me to the top 
You're everything I've got 
You catch me if I'm falling 
Oh all the way 
You take me to the top 
You catch me if I'm falling oh
