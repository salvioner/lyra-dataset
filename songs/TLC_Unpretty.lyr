I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?

Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you

I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny

Why do I look to all these things?
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, hey

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you

I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Believe I'm trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
