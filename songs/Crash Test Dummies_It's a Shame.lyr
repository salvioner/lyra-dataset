I wanna get you high

But I'm gonna make you cry

You'll hate me, and you'll miss me when I'm gone

It's been a little dry

But still I'm gonna try 

You'll miss the stuff I get when you are gone



And it's a shame, and I'm to blame

Its gonna end, we won't be friends

And when it's past, you'll have had a blast

And I'll be happy for you 

And for me, too



I see you touch your hip

I see you bite your lip

I'll miss it, when you get to movin' on 

And when I trip

On them girly strips,

They'll be just like you, or any other one



And it's a shame, and I'm to blame

It's gonna end, we won't be friends

And when it's past, you'll have had a blast

And I'll be happy for you 

And for me, too



I wanna just pretend

But I know in the end

That I will never win like this again 

But if I have to choose

I think I'd rather lose

The easy way has always been my friend



And it's a shame, and I'm to blame

It's gonna end, we won't be friends

And when it's past, you'll have had a blast

And I'll be happy for you 

And for me, too
