I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night
I was sailing on an ocean of blue
And right there by my side, much to my surprise, was you

I said, come on over baby, let me look in your eyes
Let me see the very heart of you
And I couldnt believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true

Cause you said, hey there sweet daddy, everything is alright
You know for miles theres not a telephone line
Theres not a soul to disturb us
Just come and be mine

You said, let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh
Let me be the one that you love

But now its four in the mornin, I cant sleep
I cant get you out of my mind
I keep tossin and turnin, Im yearnin for the sun to shine

Id like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express
And take you far away with me
Ive got a vision of heaven, you livin there with me

Let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh
Let me be the one that you love

Llet me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh oh
Let me be the one that you love
