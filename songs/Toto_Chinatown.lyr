Take the cable car to Jackson
It's a Friday night affair
Madam Rose's legendary honeycomb

With an ounce of intuition
You can feel it in the air
This working boy has found a place to roam

As some familiar faces
Watch every move you make
And at midnight games are snaking through the alleyway
Where they used to play

Down in Chinatown..woah
Where the nights are always longer than the days
Down in Chinatown..woah
With the dragon eyes that overlook the bay
Hey yeah

There's a lair below the city
Where the bottom dwellers go
Trying to find that thrill they've never known

A woman bores the absinthe
As the paper lanterns glow
I think Ms. Jones is better left alone

The corridors are endless
It's not hard to lose your way
Where old men smoke and gamble into Saturday
Do you want to play?

Down in Chinatown..woah
Where the nights are always longer than the days
Down in Chinatown..woah
With the dragon eyes that overlook the bay
Hey yeah

If the California street line
Is the only way you know
You might want to play it safe
Down on Grant Avenue
Where he waits for you

Down in Chinatown..woah
Where the nights are always longer than the days
Down in Chinatown..woah
With the dragon eyes that overlook the bay
Hey yeah
