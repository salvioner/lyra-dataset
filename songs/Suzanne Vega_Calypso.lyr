My name is Calypso and I have lived alone
I live on an island and I waken to the dawn
A long time ago I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning and I brought him into me
Now today come morning light
He sails away after one last night
I let him go

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden is the sweetness there that grows
My hair blows long as I sing into the wind
I tell of nights where I could taste the salt on his skin
Salt of the waves and of tears
And while he pulled away
I kept him here for years
Now I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away to be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart and my song in the wind
The sand may sting my feet and the sky will burn
It's a lonely time ahead
I do not ask him to return
I let him go
I let him go
