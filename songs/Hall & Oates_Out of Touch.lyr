Shake it up is all that we know
Using bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around are the colors we used to see

Broken ice still melts in the sun
And ties that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time <i>(time)</i>
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time <i>(time)</i>
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Living in the middle between the two extremes

Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

You're out of touch
I'm out of time <i>(time)</i>
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch

I'm out of time <i>(time)</i>
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

<i>Out of touch, out of touch
Out of time, out of time</i>
Ow

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch




I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time

But I'm out of my head when you're not around


Time





You're out of touch, I'm out of time
