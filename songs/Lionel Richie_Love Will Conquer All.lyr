Here we are
Out here, me and you 
Reaching out to each other 
Is all that we can do 

Here we stand
Trying not to fall 
There's no need to worry 
Love will conquer all 

Do you really want to know 
Just how long will last 
Will all of the bad times pass? 
How can we make things right? 

Ooh and why
Why is the world so unkind? 
We surely can find peace of mind 
If we only see the light 

Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you 
Reaching out to each other 
Is all that we can do

Whoa, here we stand
Trying not to fall 
Oh, there's no need to worry 
Love will conquer all 

Can somebody tell me why? 
Why do our dreams go wrong? 
Why can't we all belong? 
Ooh, where did we start? 

Oh, and tell me when 
When will we ever learn 
There's nowhere else we can turn 
The truth is in our hearts 

Here we are together
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Sometimes the road
Gets hard to travel 
Sometimes the pain's
Too much to bear 

Sometimes when life
Seems to unravel 
That's the time, oh, to say 
We're gonna make it anyway 

Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you 
Reaching out to each other 
Is all, is all that we can do

Here we stand
Trying not to fall 
There's no need to worry 
Love will conquer all
