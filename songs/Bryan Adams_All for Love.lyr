When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
then in love you live.
I'll make a stand. I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on,
be there when you're old,
to have and to hold.

When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
then there's a reason why.
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
from the wind and the rain,
from the hurt and pain.

Let's make it all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want,
The one you need,
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love.

When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night.
When it's love you take.
I will defend, I will fight
I'll be there when you need me.
And honor's at stake,
This vow I will make

That it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want,
The one you need.
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love.

Don't lay our love to rest
Cause we can stand up to the test.
We got everything, that and more
Then we had planned,
More than the rivers that run the land.
We've got it all, in our hands.

Now it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need,
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
then just let your feelings show.
When there's someone that you want,
when there's someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love.
