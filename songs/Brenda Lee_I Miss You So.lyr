Those happy hours I spent with you that lovely after glow most of all I miss you so
Your sweet caresses each randezvous your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so
You once filled my heart with no regrets no fears
Now you'll find my heart filled to the top with tears
I'll always love you and want you too how much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so
