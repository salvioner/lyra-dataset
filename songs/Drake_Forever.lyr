It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call


Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call


Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams: Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
"Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller"
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call


Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call


There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
