I don't know why I believe in ya baby
I don't know why I, I believe in you
I don't know why I feed on ya baby
But I feed on you

I've been living a long, long time
Seen every picture, I drink cheap wine
You don't see me, I believe in your soul
And I believe in you

And when I lay my head on your shoulder
I feel I've always known ya
And with my wisdom you will keep, it's all you need 
To clean up kid

I don't know why I believe in ya baby
I don't know why I, I believe in you
I don't know why I feed on ya baby
but I feed on you

I've been living a long, long time
Oh I've seen every picture, I drink cheap wine
You don't see me, I believe in my soul
And I believe in you

And when I lay my head on your shoulder
And when I lay my head on your shoulder
I feel I've always known ya 
And when I lay my head on your shoulder
I feel I've always known ya
And with my wisdom you will keep, it's all you need
To clean up kid
