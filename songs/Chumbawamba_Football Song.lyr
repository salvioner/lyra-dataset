Season's end
And the stands come down
One less heart
In one more town
Boxed and warm
And quiet as stone
See the animals feed
On animal bones
It's oh so nice


And it's oh so nice
It's oh so dull
But it's oh so nice
Season's end
And the stands come down
One less heart
In one more town
But it's oh so nice
