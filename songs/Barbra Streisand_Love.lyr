Love is real, real is love,
Love is feeling, feeling love,
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved.
Love is you, you and me,


Love is knowing it can be
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved.
