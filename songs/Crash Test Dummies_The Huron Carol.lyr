'Twas in the moon of wintertime 
When all the birds had fled
That mighty Gitchi Manitou 
Sent angel choirs instead
Before their light the stars grew dim
And wandering hunters heard the hymn

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

Within a lodge of broken bark 
The tender Babe was found
A ragged robe of rabbit skin 
Enwrapp'd His beauty round
And as the hunter braves drew nigh
The angel song rang loud and high

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

The earliest moon of wintertime 
Is not so round and fair
As was the ring of glory 
On the helpless infant there
The chiefs from far before him knelt 
With gifts of fur and beaver pelt

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

O children of the forest free
O sons of Manitou
The Holy Child of earth and heaven 
Is born today for you
Come kneel before the radiant Boy 
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria
