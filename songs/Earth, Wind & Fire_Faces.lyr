Many faces listen to the sound
Different places, span the globe around
Finding traces true in everyone
No there's nothing new, under the sun

Many faces listen to the sound
Different places, span the globe around
All the races, forever speeding up
Now fulfillment of the loving cup

Faces, places, races
Do-We-I-A.
