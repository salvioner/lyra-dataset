At seventeen we fell in love
Highschool sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life

I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl when you lose

Ot it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love

Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds



Feeling the pain

Oh it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady

Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we've made
It's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta cool this anger
Oh I've gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so hot, baby, yes it's so hot
I just can't take it
We were once lovers, we took our vows
Of man and wife, forever, oh
Baby please won't you listen
It hurt me so bad
Well I know I've got to leave
Too hot
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot
It's so so hot baby
We gotta cool this anger
Gotta cool this mess we made
It's so warm
So Warm
It's hot baby, yeah
Gotta run for shade, come on
My baby
Goodbye
Don't cry
