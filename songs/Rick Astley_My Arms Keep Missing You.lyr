You know I've been so lonely every night
Since you went away
Would you let me down any night
Is that the way you're made girl

I keep telling myself it's all right
Even though I cry
there's no question why
How could I be happy when

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you
since you went away
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'll
come back today

You said you wouldn't hurt me anyway
And I believe in you
We said we trust each other every day
We'd never be untrue

But I keep thinking you're telling lies
Even though I try
there's no question why
How can I be happy when

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you
since you went away
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'll
come back today

You know I've been so lonely every night
Since you went away
Would you let me down any night

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you

My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'll
come back today
