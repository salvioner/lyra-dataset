Here come the Men in Black
It's the M.I.B.s, uhh, here come the M.I.B.s
Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah

The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: M.I.B.
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black Ray Ban's on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extraterrestrial violence
But yo', we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the M.I.B.s is at
Uh and




They won't let you remember

Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom on the impending doom
But then, like, boom, black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no M.I.B.s, can I please
Do what we say, that's the way we kick it
YanawhaImean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
M.I.B.s, freezin' up all the flack


Uhh M
The Men in Black
The Men in Black

Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me
Just bounce it with me, c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me
Just slide with me, c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me
Take a walk with me, c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze

Ooaaoo


The galaxy defenders
Right on, right on



Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin'
I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me, if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the men in
That's the men in







Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember
