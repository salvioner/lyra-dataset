How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the other side

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know "am I still a slut?"
I've got to take it on the other side

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul-mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

How long, how long
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever
