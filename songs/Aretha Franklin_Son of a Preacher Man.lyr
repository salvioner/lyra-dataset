Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered around and starting talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes he was, he was, ooh, yes he was

Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin'  to me
He'd come'n tell me "Everything is all right "
He'd kiss and tell me "Everything is all right "
Can I get away again tonight ?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who can ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman


How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin'me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes he was, he was, ooh, yes he was


He was the sweet-talkin'  son of a preacherman

Was the son of a preacherman


Was the sweet-talkin'  son of a preacherman
