You had you dreams
And I had mine
Eyes wide open and we dreamed together
I never know how we keep
Our shit together

Wondering
Is this love or illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

It's nuclear
We're two here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
It's nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up






You had your half
And I had mine
But now there's no such thing
As you and me
I was so used to feeling incomplete

Wondering
Is this Love or illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

It's nuclear
We're two here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
It's nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up

Goin' all the way

Anytime the climates change between us
We share a bond they can't restrict
That can't be touched
So amazing super power
Take over
Never lose the energy

It's nuclear
We're two here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
It's nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up
