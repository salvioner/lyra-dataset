I'm an opportunity and I knock so softly
Sometimes I get loud when I wish everybody'd just
get off me
So many players you'd think I was a ball game
Its every man for themselves, there are no
team mates
This life gets lonely when everybody wants
something
They'll smile up in your face
But they'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there

Surrounded by familiar faces without names
None of them know me or want to share my pain
And they only wish to bask in my light, then fade
away
To win my love, to them a game
To watch me live my life in vain
When all is done and the glitter fades, fades
away
They'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there

I drank your poison coz you told me its wine
Shame on you if you fooled me once
Shame on me if you fooled me twice
I didn't know the price
You'll get yours eventually

So what good am I to you if I can't be broken?
You'll get yours, yes you'll get yours
Eventually
