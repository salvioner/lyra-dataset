When I'm with you
It doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing
I'm with you that's all that matters

Time passes much too quickly
When we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, whoa, no
I wish I could sing it to you

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Mostly I'm silent, mmm, mmm, mmm
Silent, la, la, la, la

Never think about words to say

When I kiss you
I feel a thousand different feelings
A color of chills all over my body

And when I feel them
I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, whoa, no
Try to put into words

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Mostly I'm silent, silent
La, la, la, la, silent

Only the beginning
Of what I want to feel forever
Yeah, whoa, oh, oh

Yes, only the beginning
Of what I want to feel forever
Only the beginning
Only just the start, yeah

I got to get you into my life, mama
Got to get you next to me
Yes, only the beginning
Only just the start

Hey hey hey hey, hmm mmm

Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning...
