Hey, yeah


Hey, light skinned girl with the curly hair
Don't say you're from Delaware
I can't see it
Oh, I can't believe it

Ok, where your daddy from, where your momma from
I need to meet dem
And tell your mom to come prove it
And I bet she can't do it

But I think I'm in love
With all of your features
Can I get a hug
It was so nice to meet ya

You and all of your friends
Look so exotic
So you go get them
And I'm gonna get my partners

We can make it a night to remember
I won't lie to ya baby
You're telling me you're Japanese
And I tell you maybe

But you really got sex appeal
So I really gotta keep it real
Shorty, I want my fix, I put you on my list
I want you on my wrist cause




I'm trying to get mixed up tonight like

Excuse me miss, what's your name
Where ya from, can I come

Looking for a mixed girl

Excuse me miss

Skinny black girl with the real straight hair
I know it ain't no weave up there
If it is I can't see it
Oh, I can't believe it

OK, where your boyfriend, because I got dividends
Now are you listening
Do you even speak English
Oh, I can't believe it

Mama I think I'm in love
With all of that slow winding
I'm in the reggae club
She's gotta be from an island

Even all of your friends
Look so exotic
So she's gonna get them
And I'm gonna get my partners

We can make it a night to remember
I won't lie to ya baby
You're telling me you from Duvall County and I'm gonna tell you maybe
