Long ago
Just like the hearse, you
Died to get in again
We are
So far from you

Burnin' on
Just like a match, you
Strike to incinerate
The lives
Of everyone you know

And what's the worst to take

From every heart you break?

And like a blade you stain

Well I've been holdin' on tonight

What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are
The very hurt you sold

And what's the worst you take?

From every heart you break?

And like a blade you stain

Well I've been holdin' on tonight

What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend?
To leave, and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide

What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
