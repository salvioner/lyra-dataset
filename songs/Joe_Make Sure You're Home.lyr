Baby, baby, since you went away
My skies are gray, my world is fading
I see love is walking 'round my way
The holidays, the celebrating

People everywhere with smiles upon their face
Anticipating
But their smiles are not for me
'Cause deep inside my heart is aching

When you're out there on the road
I'm missing you, I can't hold on
Baby, on this special day, put your work aside
Make sure you're home

Baby, come home this Christmas night
Don't leave me home alone, baby, come home
It's just not right, no, it ain't right
For you to leave me alone, make sure you're home

Colored lights and Christmas ornaments
Through frosted windows, candles glow
Love is sharing all the Christmas joy
Like sculptured ice out in the snow

Got this fire burning bright
But you're not here to hold me tight
On my knees, I hope the angels my prayer
To Silent Night

When you're out there on the road
I'm missing you, I can't hold on
Baby, on this special day, put your work aside
Make sure you're home

Baby, come home this Christmas night
Don't leave me home alone, baby, come home
It's just not right, no, it ain't right
For you to leave me alone, make sure you're home

I got a present waiting for you here when you get home
I can't wait to have you wrapped up in my arms
All I want this year is that you get one precious gift
Share this special night, share this special night

So make sure you're home, baby, come home
This Christmas night don't leave me home alone
Baby, come home, it's just not right, no, it ain't right
For you to leave me alone, make sure you're home

Make sure you're home, baby, come home
This Christmas night don't leave me home alone
Baby, come home, it's just not right, no, it ain't right
For you to leave me alone, make sure you're home
