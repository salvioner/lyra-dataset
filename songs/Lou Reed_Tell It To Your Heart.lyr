I was staring through a telescope at night
at a large light in the sky
Its spinning lights reminded me of you
A star spinning in orbit lighting up the sky
Or maybe it was not a star at all

I was standing by the Hudson River's edge at night
Looking out across the Jersey shore
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name

And I thought your name should be dancing
beamed from satellites
Larger than any billboard in Times Square

Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
NYC lovers, tell it to your heart

<i>(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)</i>

I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
I guess I couldn't sleep
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week

Maybe I should wake you up
But by then it might be gone
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky

I ran outside down a darkened street
Listening to my boot heels click
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette

When I turned the corner
My spinning light was in the street
They were filming a commercial on TV

Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
NYC Lovers, tell it to your heart

<i>(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)</i> Tell it to your heart
<i>(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)</i> Tell it to your heart

<i>(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)</i>
