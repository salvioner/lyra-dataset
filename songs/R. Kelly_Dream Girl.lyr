So amazing, unbelievacle, miraculous women you are.
Incredible, unforgetable, your the worlds greatest by far.
Sensational, so lovable, my cinderella you are.
So beautiful, ghetto fabulous, the reason I wish upon a star.
As I lay me down to sleep I'll pray your heart ill always keep it.
Hope you feel the same.
So baby come and hop on board my life and,
Just let love take us away.

Dream girl lets take a flight,
Far away to a paradise.
Dream girl lets take a ride,
Destination rainbow skys.
Dream girl lets kiss and hug,
On a beach with white sand and all white doves.
Dream girl lets cuddle up.
Somewhere, where ever and make sweet love.

Baby you are my dream, dream, dream, dream girl
My sunshine, my blueskys, love is who you are to me girl,
My angel, my piece of mind, woman you have come to set me free.
Love makin, breath takin', sweet valentines to me.
Heart racin', creatin', and incredible fire within' me.
I believe in you and me, together for all eternity.
And I hope you feel the same
So baby come and hop on board my life and, let love take us away.
