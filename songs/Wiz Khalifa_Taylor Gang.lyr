Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang

On my way from Cali,
So you know I'm smokin' flavor
Ain't fuckin' wit blunts,
You know we only smokin' paper
And I throw it up so that they know just what my gang is
Mother fuck a hater


I left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair,
Im the coach I can show you how to be a player,
Five-eights is the fitted, bitches love my hair,
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear,
The let me in the club fuck a dress code,
Me and all my niggas rollin' up the best smoke,
Og kush from the West Coast,
Oh you down to fuck? Well shortie let's go,
Diamonds in my chain niggas tryin' to steal my lane,
Tryin to get my brain bitch I'm reppin' Taylor Gang,
Smoke till I'm insane, drinkin till I'm throwin' up
Only papers if you Taylor'd nigga throw it up,
High socks, low cuts,
Smell that good weed then you know it's us,
That yellow car pulling up them niggas ain't hot so they close to us,
Got 'em flying two fingers and hold em up,

Bought a crib like scarefaces, this is my world
All my niggas down to bang but we can try worse
Smoking ounces to the head, feel my mind twirls
Im the mayor and my bitch look like a fly girl,
Topic of discussion talk shit cause they bitches love us,
Plus them niggas suckas I got that in living color,
All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors,
All I do is fuck em once, and I don't call or give 'em numbers,
Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress,
Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, boflex,
Throw your set up what you rep when you twistin ya fingers,
Real recoginze real and my nig you a stranger,
Gotta bank for a scrilla, a brain full of papers,
Got a phone full of hoes, and a gang full of Taylors

You see me out I rep my gang,
Used serve that John McCain,

Hold up they don't know my name?
Chevy who? Chevy who?

Look at all that shit these dollars do,
Gettin all this money wit you know who,
It's Taylor Gang over you,
We poppin bottles gang signs,
All my niggas gang signs,
Rollin up gang signs,
Niggas trippin, bang time,
Hold up, what they say bout us?

Same niggas gotta get the ok 'bout stuff,
They ain't in the same league,
They don't play like us,
No stems no seeds keep that rolled up,
Bang on them hoes, we does that,
Socket work, I just had a plug for that,

Get your Taylor on,
Hold for whatever you rep,
Throwin' up the gang,
4800 still reppin' a set

Got these niggas trippin',
And these bitches too,
They just haters though,
No matter what we do,
What up cuh, on the left side,
It's Taylor Gang, and that's or die,
Chevy!
