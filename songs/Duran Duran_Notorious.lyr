No-no-notorious, notorious
No-no-notorious

I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out
Not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives?

You own the money 
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again. No-no-Notorious


So long as boys make a noise
Fools run rings to break up
Something they'll never destroy

And who really gives a damn for a flaky bandit?
Don't ask me to bleed about it
I need this blood to survive

You own the money 
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again.

That's why I've done it again. No. No
That's why I've done it again. No-no-Notorious
