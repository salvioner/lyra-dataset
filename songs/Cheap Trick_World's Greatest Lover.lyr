You're the world's greatest lover in my world
You're the world's greatest lover in my world

In my heart, in my world
There is no one else
In the whole wide world

And think of home
As i sit and write this letter
And think of home

In my heart, in my world
There is music that i've never heard
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
In my world, in my world
Like i've never heard in my world

I ain't a poet, baby, i'm a man

I ain't a poet, baby

You're the world's greatest lover in my world
You're the world's greatest lover in my world

In my heart, in my world
There is music that i've never heard
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
In my world, in my world
Like i've never heard in my world
In my world
I'm comin' home darlin', darlin'
