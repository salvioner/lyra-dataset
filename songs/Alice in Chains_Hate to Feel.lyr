What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate

What the fuck will it take
Drown myself in my wake
Another shaggy D.A.
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate

Stare at me with empty eyes and point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you what you're scared to see

I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all

So climb the walls, thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now

What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet

New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face exactly what I am

I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all

-Solo-

What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet

New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face exactly who I am

I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all

I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
