Running fast and missing but cannot help convincing.
The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin.
It's not meant to hurt you but let me assure you,
It's not what I said but intentions you've read.

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left,  yeah
There's nothing more you can't ignore,
And say it makes no difference to me.
It makes no difference to me

Now that you're older life's weighing on your shoulders.
You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight.
With most things so basic you might as well face it.
You can't help but worry it's all just begun

So when you hold onto the past then you,
Will break down what little is left, yeah
There's nothing more you can't ignore,
And say it makes no difference to me.

It makes no difference, to me
It makes no difference, to me,
It makes no difference, to me
It makes no difference

So when you hold onto the past then you,
Will break down what little is left. yeah
There's nothing more you can't ignore,
And say it makes no difference to me.
it makes no difference
It makes no difference, to me
It makes no difference
It makes no difference, to me
