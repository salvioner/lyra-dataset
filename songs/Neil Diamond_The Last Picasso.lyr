Words and Music by Neil Diamond

The last Picasso, the last Picasso was just acquired by some old museum, and Don Quixote, Well Don Quixote the old man's rhyme has lost its reason; which only reminds me have I remembered to say that without you this life of plenty, would seem so empty, the last Picasso. Oh me and you--me oh me oh me oh me and you-- We, we can sigh--me oh me oh me oh me oh we can sigh. The last Picasso, the last Picasso may gather dust amid the ruins, and Don Quixote, Well Don Quixote may no longer make his wishful tunes; but I still have you and I will have you when ev'rything else is gone and done with. We'll be like one with the last Picasso. Oh me and you--me oh me oh me oh me oh me and you-- We, we can sigh--me oh me oh me oh me oh we can sigh. Oh, me and you--me oh me oh me oh me oh me and you-- We, we can sigh--me oh me oh me oh me oh we can sigh. Oh, me and you--we we can sigh me oh me oh me oh we can sign. Oh, me and you.
