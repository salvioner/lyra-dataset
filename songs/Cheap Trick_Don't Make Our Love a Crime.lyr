Give me passion, I'll make it good
I'm not crazy, just misunderstood
And I wanna be caught with you
Oh yeah
I've been framed all my life
Didn't do it, I'm no enemy
Now I wanna be blamed with you
Oh no

Don't you make our love a crime
Please don't make our love a crime
If you do we'll all regret it in time
So don't you make our love a crime

You murdered just a part of me
I'm still alive and breathin' free
I wanna be punished with you
I know what you're goin' through
You gave me a fatal bite
I wanna spend my time with you, you, you

Don't you make our love a crime
Please don't make our love a crime
If you do we'll all regret it in time
So don't you make our love a crime

I know what you're goin' through
It's happened to me once before
And I know what you're gonna do
I wanna spend some time with you
It's stronger than it was before
And I've saved it up for you, you, you

Don't you make our love a crime
So please don't make our love a crime
If you do we'll all regret it in time
So don't you make our love a crime
A crime, no
