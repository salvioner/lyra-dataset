Zoo time is she and you time
The mammals are your favourite type, and you want her tonight
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat
You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos, elephants and tacky tigers

This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me that's gonna leave

Flying domestic flying
And when the stewardess is near do not show any fear
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat
You are a khaki-coloured bombardier it's Hiroshima that you're nearing

This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me that's gonna leave

Daily, except for Sunday
You dawdle in to the cafe where you meet her each day
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat
As twenty cannibals have hold of you, they need their protein just like you do

This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me that's gonna leave

Shower, another shower
You've got to look your best for her and be clean everywhere
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat
The rain is pouring on the foreign town, the bullets cannot cut you down

This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me that's gonna leave

Census, the latest census
There'll be more girls who live in town though not enough to go 'round
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat
You know that this town isn't big enough
Not big enough for the both of us
This town isn't big enough
Not big enough for the both of us
And I ain't gonna leave
