Come on baby, could you ever be
Just a little close to me

Ooh ooh ooh
Could we ever forget tonight

Come on baby, let's take a stroll
You're feelin' warm so don't be cold

Ooh ooh ooh
We'll never forget tonight

What a wonderful night to be
The stars must be my friends
To shine for me

Come on baby, now don't you be cold
Just remember that love is gold

Ooh ooh ooh
We will never forget tonight
