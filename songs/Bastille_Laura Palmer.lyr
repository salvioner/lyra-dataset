Walking out into the dark 
Cutting out a different path 
Lead by your beating heart

All the people of the town 
Cast their eyes right to the ground 
In matters of the heart

The night was all you had 
You ran into the night from all you had 
Found yourself a path upon the ground 
You ran into the night; you can't be found

But

This is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Summer evening breezes blew 
Drawing voices deep from you 
Lead by your beating heart

What a year and what a night 
What terrifying final sights 
Put out your beating heart

The night was all you had 
You ran into the night from all you had 
Found yourself a path upon the ground 
You ran into the night; you can't be found

But

This is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 

If you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky, why? 
To see where it would fall, will you come down at all?
If you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky, why? 
To see where your bullet would fall, will you come down at all?

This is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 

This is your racing heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
