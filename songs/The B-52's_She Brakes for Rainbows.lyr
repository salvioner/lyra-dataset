Here comes Brenda
Brenda Holiday
Through she hasn't that much to say

She knows where the rain goes
She brakes
She brakes for rainbows
Fly Brenda
Fly Brenda
Window in the weather
Flowers in her hair
Footprints on the ceiling
How did they get there

She knows where the rain goes
She brakes
She brakes for rainbows
