It was a summer night,
The stars were all aligned,
You, you, you, you showed up,
And blew my mind.

We didn't sleep at all,
Played records all night long,
That, that, that night,
I kind of fell in love.

Something in your kiss,
Made my body electric,
You set me free.
That night, brough to life,
For the magic that's inside,
Of you and me.

Wherever you are,
You are forever on my mind.
Wherever you are,
Know that our love will never die.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,
Wherever you are.

Electric wire love,
The sun was coming up,
Red, red, red wine,
And whiskey on your tongue.

Tangled up in your sheets,
You saw the real me,
You, you, you, you give me,
Something to believe.

Something in your kiss,
Made my body electric,
You set me free.
That night, brough to life,
For the magic that's inside,
Of you and me.

Wherever you are,
You are forever on my mind.
Wherever you are,
Know that our love will never die.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,
Wherever you are.


Wherever you are.

Wherever you are.

Nothin' lasts forever,
But I will always remember,
Those nights we spent together,
Wherever, wherever.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,


Wherever you are.

Love will never die,
Wherever you are.
