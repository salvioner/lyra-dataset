The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again

I believe in love
And who knows where or when



But it's comin' around again






I know nothin?stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's comin' around again
