All the time I was searching
Nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
But no-one listening

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh I know you're going
But I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons for being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else

But listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
