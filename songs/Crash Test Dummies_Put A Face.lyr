Put a face
on the page
into scenes
put a time
to a place
with a theme

Give it rhythm
meet the strict
rhyming scheme
get it down
write it out
make it seem

Into a room
that feels more
than a dream,
but a place
that we all
yearn to be

Like a real history,
Kings and Queens;
And the dawn,
As the birds start to sing,
The dust-motes
Lit up by a beam
Of the sun
Through the window
That stream
