Sittin' here together, baby we're all alone 
Now I can tell ya, girl, you turn me on
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Bring out the lovin', lovin' desire, baby
You got the match, oh that lights the fire
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Mama-mama, mama-mama
Mama-mama, mama-mama

I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Mama-mama, mama-mama
Mama-mama, mama-mama

I get lifted, I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
