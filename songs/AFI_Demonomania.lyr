Look upon me
I am the beast

Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My father was a wolf
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My mother was a whore

You check and see
Reality of the wolf
It's in the blood
I wanna be the fucking savior

Humans are weak
What else you fucking do?
Humans are weak
I want your blood

Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My father was a wolf
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My mother was a whore
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My mother was a whore
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania
My father was a wolf
