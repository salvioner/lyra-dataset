Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's somethin' I just have to say
I don't think I could hide what I'm feelin' inside another day
Knowin' I love you

And I, I'm gettin' too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I tell you tonight would you turn out the lights and walk away
Knowin' I love you?

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man and make you understand, Amanda
I love you

And, I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me to feel this way
I don't wanna lose you

So it may be too soon, I know
The feelin' takes so long to grow
If I tell you today, will you turn me away and let me go?
I don't wanna lose you

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda


You and I, I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie, girl
Tomorrow may be too late

You, you and I, girl, we can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late, ohohoho

And feelin' the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
