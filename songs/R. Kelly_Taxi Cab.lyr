Bright nigh, city lights and a city that never sleeps
Loud music and talks people where all the party sings
I saw a girl and I notices that she noticed me
Whe set mojitos then she told me all about her dreams
And we made love in a taxi cab,It  reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph and I can't get her out of my head

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab X 3

And the ... now she's been
I come alone, come at floor what she said?
I come alone, come at door to me

Looking at the rear view she said to me let go and be free
Then she told the driver mind his business and then where there on me
Then I told her which is 15 minutes from my home
But she didn't stop, she kept saying it feels so incredible wrong

And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had

Now the memory's like a photograph oh baby girl, and I can't get her out of my head
Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3
And the ... now she's been

And all have been so soon, girl
I didn't even get a name, ... don't ... got a room
It was like a hotel room, ... people love the best ...

And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph oh baby girl, photograph baby, and I can't get her out of my head
Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3
And the ... now she's been
The girl's meant for me
We made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, X 3
That we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph, and I can't get her out of my head.
