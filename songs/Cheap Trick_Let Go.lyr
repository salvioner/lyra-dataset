I took your photographs, I threw them all away
I put your calls on hold 'cause I got nothin' to say
Hangin' on to you, that was my first mistake
Yeah, yeah

But some things you can never let go
Some things you can never let go

You took the credit cards, you took the bank account
You took my sanity. You've got me all drawn out
I'd give it all away to get you off my mind
Yeah, yeah

But some things you can never let go
Some things you should never let 'em show
Some things you can never let go

Let Go!, Let Go!
Don't keep draggin' it out
Let Go!, Let Go!
You're no good for me now
How much more can I take?
I can't spend my whole life in the dark
Now you gotta let go of my heart

I took your photographs, I threw them all aside
Forget your so called friends, I kissed 'em all goodbye
If I walk away, would you be satisfied?
Yeah, yeah

But some things you can never let go
Some things you should never let 'em show
Some things you can never let go

Let Go!, Let Go!
Don't keep draggin' it out
Let Go!, Let Go!
You're no good for me now
How much more can I take?
I can't spend my whole life in the dark
