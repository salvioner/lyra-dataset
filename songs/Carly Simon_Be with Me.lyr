River runs to the sea
Salmon runs to the sea
If you need someone
You can run to me

Flowers grow to the sun
Shines on everyone
If you've lost the warmth
I will give you some

Lay back on the starry night
Feel as big and as small as you are

Well I see who you are
And I like what I see
If you want to be
You can be with me
