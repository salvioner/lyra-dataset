See the fool who mimicks the sun
Burning out like a quasar--pulsing
Your lunar laugh and smokey dreams
Bare your soul and take control
While the spaced out space chick
Keeps the cosmic beat
And day-glo daffodils
Are pushing violent from the earth

Hallucinating Pluto yeah yeah...
Love will turn our universe
Hallucinating Pluto oh whoooo!
Love will turn our universe
I could exist here happily!

Fields of poppies blind for sunshine
Burning paths of fluid joy
Bare your soul and take control
If the wolves are howling outside your door
Invite them in and make them beg for more
While the day-glo daffodils
Are pushing violent from the earth

Dripping wet and screaming...
Now is the time
Now is the time-now is the time-now is the time
For action
Hit the road...overload
I'm in a dancing mode

Hallucinating Pluto yeah yeah...
Love will turn our universe
Hallucinating Pluto oh whoooo!

Get on your laser daddy and ride...
Through your telescope into the night

Pursue the lost realms of night...
The last realms of fear
Nighttime has stopped...bring on the aliens!

Our love is freed from the icy tundra
And everyone wants to take the next flight out!

Ride Daddy Ride
Hallucinating Pluto
Love will turn our universe!
Hallucinating Pluto
Love will turn our universe!
Hallucinating Pluto yeah yeah
Hallucinating Pluto oh whooo
Ride Daddy Ride
I could exist here, I could exist here happily!
