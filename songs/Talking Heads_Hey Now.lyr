I wanna bicycle
I wanna popsicle
I wanna space face
Buy me a cherry face now

Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
Hey now!

Hey now now!

I wanna video
I wanna rock and roll
Take me to the shopping mall
Buy me a rubber ball now

Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!

Every night sun goes down
And the people are staying at home
You can tell your momma & daddy
Leave those children alone

They know what they're doin'
They ain't runnin' away
Uncle John said, "Tell Aunt Mary
I got nothing to say"


Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!

Ho---
Would the light come hitcha in the eye
Hey---
Gonna stop, gonna getcha by surprise!

Every night when the sun goes down
And the people are staying at home
You can tell your momma & daddy
Leave those children alone

They know what they're doin'
They ain't runnin' away
Uncle John said, "Tell Aunt Mary
I got nothing to say"


Hey now
Hey now
Hey now now
Hey now
Hey now
Hey now now

Ho---
Would the light come hitcha in the eye
Hey---
Gonna stop, gonna getcha by surprise

I am the king of the world
The boss of the boys & girls
You can live till a 100 & 10
If you listen to what I said

Hey now
