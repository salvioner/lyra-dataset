I'll go my way by myself
It's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friend
I'll try to apply myself
And teach my heart how to sing
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I'm by myself
I'm by myself
I'm by myself
Alone
