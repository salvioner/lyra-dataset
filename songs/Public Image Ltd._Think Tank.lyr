Could have been a major problem
But i did not-I didn't look back
And all you dirty druggies
Chicken shit-sad sacks
Rewriting history
But still so pale, so shallow
Tampering in my story
Standing in my shadow
Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank

Think tank: burning off steam, I'll let you dream

Dream on
Mother nature's kind regards
Balancing the house of cards
Assuming and consuming


Of the peg commodities
The politics of common sense
Smiles and metaphors
Violence as self defense
The languages of lesser whores
I might no know much-but I know all this
Did you think-I would not notice
Love loves money-and delights in praise

Easy money as a virtue, watch it quickly fade
-------------------------------------------------------But I did not-I don't look back
And it could have been a problem
