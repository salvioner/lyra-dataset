Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July

People dancing people laughing
A man selling ice-cream
Singing Italian songs

Can you dig it, yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July

People talkin' really smiling
A man playin' guitar
And singing for us all

Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it, yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colors of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost, oh no, no,

Funny days in the park,
Every day's the Fourth of July
Funny days in the park,
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, people touching,
A real celebration
Waiting for us all,
If we want it, really want it

And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day
