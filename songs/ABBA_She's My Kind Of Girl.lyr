Look at her face, it's a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do

And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walkin' for hours and talkin'
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
