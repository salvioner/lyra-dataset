There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life
And I know it will bring me home

There's a choir singing
With a force that can light the sky
I will join with a voice deep inside
Anthems for joys gone by
And for joys I am sure will come

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
When my heart sings
Of golden things

There's a dove ascending
Like my thoughts in the summer sky
And she carries my soul along
Clear to eternity
And I know I am not alone
