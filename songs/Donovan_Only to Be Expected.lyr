Leitch

All-time low the weatherman said
I don't need him to tell me that I know
There's a heavy pressure building
And over all the earth I feel it grow.

It's only to be expected
When we poison the water, when we poison the air
Only to be expected
When we communicate hate everywhere
Only to be expected
When we're way out of sync with Nature's way
We're only interested if it pay.

Boys and girls in every land
Go hungry even now, in lines they stand
Food is burnt to balance banks
And taxes go to buy missiles and tanks.

It's only to be expected
When we poison the water, when we poison the air
Only to be expected
When we communicate hate everywhere
Only to be expected
When we're way out of sync with Nature's way
We're only interested if it pay.

Only to be expected
When we poison the water, when we poison the air
Only to be expected
When we communicate hate everywhere
Only to be expected
When we're way out of sync with Nature's way.

Only to be expected
When we poison the water, when we poison the air
Only to be expected
When we communicate hate everywhere
Only to be expected
