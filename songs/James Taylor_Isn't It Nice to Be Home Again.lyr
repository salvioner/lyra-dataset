Late last night so far away
I dreamed my-self a dream  
Well I dreamed I was so all alone  
Isn't it nice to be home again?  
I said welcome home  
Didn't we miss your smiling face  
Well the sun was nice in L.A.
Sun-shine   
Isn't it nice to be home again?   
Well I said isn't it nice to be home a-gain?
