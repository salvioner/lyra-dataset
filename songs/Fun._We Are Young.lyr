Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now, I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight <i>(na na na na na na)</i>
Just carry me home tonight <i>(na na na na na na)</i>
Carry me home tonight <i>(na na na na na na)</i>
Just carry me home tonight <i>(na na na na na na)</i>

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
