Stay out of the light
Of the photographs that I gave you
You can say a prayer if you need to
Or just get in line and I'll grieve you

Can I meet you, alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Oh, another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue
To hide my face

Oh, another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe

The kind of dirty
Where the water
Never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those

Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go

Touched by angels though
I fall out of grace
I did it all so maybe
I'd live this every day

Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe

It ain't the money
And it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies
I claim and those

Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go

Down
And down we go
And down we go
And down we go
And we all fall down

I tried
I tried

And we'll all dance alone
To the tune of your death
We'll love again
We'll laugh again
And it's better off this way

And never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now

Well never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now

I tried
One more night
One more night
Well I'm laughing, crying, laughing

I tried
Well I tried
Well I tried
'Cause I tried
But I lied
I, I tried
I tried
I tried

And we'll love again
We'll laugh again
We'll cry again
And we'll dance again
And it's better off this way
So much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed

And never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
