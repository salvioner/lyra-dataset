A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a Busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

But a scrub is checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with no deadbeat ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you

If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No <i>(no scrub)</i> scrub <i>(no love)</i>
No <i>(no scrub)</i> scrub <i>(no love)</i> no no
No <i>(no scrub)</i> scrub <i>(no love)</i> no
No <i>(no scrub)</i> scrub <i>(no love)</i> no no

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

See? If you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never risin'
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the G's to please me
And bounce from here to the coast of overseas

So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget to focus on the picture in front of me
Do it clear as DVD on digital TV screens

Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular and then I'll get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition

Mr. Big Willie, if ya really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly hoe?

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
