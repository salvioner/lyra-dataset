My romance doesn't need to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May
No shining star
No hideaway
No soft guitar

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
'Cause my romance doesn't need a thing but you
