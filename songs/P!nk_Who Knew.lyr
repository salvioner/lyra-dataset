You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed in everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
Before they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever and ever
Who knew

I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss I'll cherish until we meet again

And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep

My darling, who knew
My darling, my darling, who knew
My darling I miss you
My darling
Who knew
Who knew
