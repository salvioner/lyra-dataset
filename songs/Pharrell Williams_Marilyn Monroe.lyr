Different
Oh yeah
 
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We cannot help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance and elevate each other

Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want and it's crystal clear

Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me

I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

Why, why do I have to lie
Pretend, make believe or hide?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl

Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want and it's crystal clear

Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me

I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl on girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

I just want a different girl, oh
What's wrong with that? Eh
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?

In honor of the groove and to all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you and we take it back

We're so hard, we're so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?
