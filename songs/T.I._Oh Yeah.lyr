Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone
Them bitches say they miss me, tell em shawty not long
Got them so turned on till they so turned out
'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin' that loud
I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow
Catch me at fillet chow up in Vegas in town
It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row
Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go
No they all wanna go, I make em say
Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey
Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say
And if that broad wanna go she should say
Now from LA to the bay, I make em say
And from New York to MIA, bitches say
From Chi Town to the D, bitches scream
San Louis Houston do you wanna go with me

Hey you can catch me in Atlanta with my pedal to the floor
On that 5, 99 guts like a bloody nose
Ain't no secret how I kick it nigga everybody know
'Bout my paper sorry no time for you haters gotta go
When I'm on the westcoat in that ghost on that low
One five for a movie, quarter mil for a show
Gotta pill in a bottle for the rod for a ho
Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho
Thank God for my lady I know they be on that radio wiling
While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling
On a big dot is he really that hot
Ain't you too niggga guess not
Bitches hoppin' on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car
Walk away with five or six as I'm passing by the bars
See I'm tuggin' on my zipper as I fire up my cigar
Let's get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin' till tomorrow

Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone
Them bitches say they miss me, tell em shawty not long
Got them so turned on till they so turned out
'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin' that loud
I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow
Catch me at fillet chow up in Vegas in town
It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row
Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go
No they all wanna go, I make em say
Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey
Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say
And if that broad wanna go she should say
Now from LA to the bay, I make em say
And from New York to MIA, bitches say
From Chi Town to the D, bitches scream
San Louis Houston do you wanna go with me

Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page
Peach king off the leash out the cage on the streets
Kill nigga like A's cut bitches like blades
Shine always, fuck you when whatever y'all say
Bitch nigga I'm paid even when I'm locked up
Heard nigga went broke, well shawty not us
Quarter K in the Benz they say shawty washed up
To a bitch, bullshit then shawty popped off in yo motherfucking town
Just to show it's going down, my brother and my lil cousin got you lady goin' 'round
Nigga I don't want her, I'm so superior by far
She'll never see the inside of my car

Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone
Them bitches say they miss me, tell em shawty not long
Got them so turned on till they so turned out
'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin that loud
I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow

It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row
Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go
No they all wanna go, I make em say
Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey
Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say
And if that broad wanna go she should say
Now from LA to the bay, I make em say
