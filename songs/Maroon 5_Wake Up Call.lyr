I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say 'we'?
I never would have made it, babe

If you needed love, well then ask for love
Could have given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault, 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't think so

I would've bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your love is screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground

If you needed love, well then ask for love
Could have given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault, 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore, no
He won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
I don't feel so bad...
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
