It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
I'll make everything alright
All these things that I've done
Now what have I become
And where'd I go wrong

I don't mean to hurt
Just to put you first
I won't tell you lies
I will stand accused
With my hand on my heart
I'm just trying to say..

I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me

I know that I can't take back all of the mistakes
But I will try
Although it's not easy, I know you believe me
Cause I would not lie
Don't believe their lies
Told through jealous eyes
They don't understand
I won't break your heart
I won't bring you down
But I will have to say

I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me

I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me
