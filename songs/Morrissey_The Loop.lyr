I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 


I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through
