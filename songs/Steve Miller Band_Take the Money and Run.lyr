This here's a story 'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue
Two young lovers with nothin' better to do
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose

They headed down to old El Paso
That's where they ran into a great big hassle
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
Bobbie Sue took the money and run

Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run

Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his livin' off other people's taxes

Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy Joe caught up with her the very next day
They got the money, hey, you know they got away
They headed down south and they're still running today, singin'

Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run...
