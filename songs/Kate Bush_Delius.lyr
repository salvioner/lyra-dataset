Ooh, he's a moody old man
Song of summer in his hand
Ooh, he's a moody old man
In, in, in his hand
In his hand

Delius
Delius amat
Syphilus
Deus
Genius, ooh

To be sung of a summer night on the water
Ooh, on the water

"Ta, ta-ta!
In B, Fenby!
Ta, ta-ta!"

Delius
Delius amat
Syphilus
Deus
Genius, ooh

To be sung of a summer night on the water
Ooh, on the water
On the water
