Father's hands are lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mother's hands are serving meals
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non Ã¨ stata scritta

With mouths to feed
Just tryna keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk <i>(Let's talk)</i>

You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive

But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
And too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

It's so bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too late, so wrong, so long
Too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk <i>(Let's talk)</i>

Father's hands are lined with guilt <i>(Guilt)</i>
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are

We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad
It's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

It's so bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

<i>(No time, last one, let's go)</i>
