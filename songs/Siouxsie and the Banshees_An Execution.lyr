This is what she saw ...
The unsuspecting horse was held fast to the ground
Whilst some soldiers slit open its belly
The guilty gypsy was shoved inside the horse's belly
With only his head protruding from the dying
Beast, another soldier, then sewed up the wound
With the culprit inside, condemned to die, along
With the putrifying animal, screaming
