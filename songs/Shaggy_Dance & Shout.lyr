Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover

And another day

Move to this, let me see you jump and twist
Pump ya fist 'cause you know it's hard to resist
That how you know you're rollin' with the love specialist
Feel the vibe baby put the groove in ya hips
The night is young, so let's go roll with the fun
You got some gum, take it out, gimme some
'Cause I'm about to play an old girl like a drum
She be shaggitized before it all said and done

Girl, what you gon' do with all that body
{Shake it up all night}
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody
{Tell me what you like}

Gotta holla' to my fellas who be hangin' by the bathroom door
Waitin' for the honeys as they leave the dance floor
Thats right you got the digits, y'all ready for the score
Now who's the dog, you the one that's on all four

I gotta get this party to a new height
Keep it tight, ain't got no time for no fight
You wanna be a player, better know to do it right
kissin all the honeys under the disco light

Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody

Dancin' to the beat with a passion

So baby-baby, let me see you move your body
Pan the dancehall floor
Gotta one, just jigga, shake it up, gimme more
Jerk chicken on the grill, so make the champagne pour
Girl, don't be a drag, I might show you the door
{What?!}
I like to see bodies baked and shaped
Dressed in lace huggin a perfect shape
Girls local and out of state
I got a couple of them in my gates ready to mate
