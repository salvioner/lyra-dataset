A crack appeared inside a wall,
A door sprang up around it.
Each of these so finely drawn
I could not believe I found it.
 
A wildish wind blew it open wide,
My childish mind followed on outside,
And so I found myself among
My hearts delight surrounded.

A world of wonder lay without,
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non è stata scritta
With field and forest, clouds and sun
Cascades of salt water falling.
 
Heights and valleys, dark ravines
Ivy thick and wild, deep and thorny scenes,
And yet each thing did love its place
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non è stata scritta

And so and so it goes.
And so and so it goes.

I asked the one whose land this was
If I might have a token
To take with me back to the other side
To have and to keep unspoken.
 
I asked three times and was thrice denied.
I asked again without my pride
/* Carattere non valido - questa riga non è stata scritta
Returned as one now broken,
 
To a crumb, a rag, a withered leaf
In the chilly winds of cold relief
I knew myself as I had been,
As from a dream awoken.
 
And so and so it goes.
And so and so it goes.
 
But then a crack appeared inside a wall
And a door sprang up around it.
