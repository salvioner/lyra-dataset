Maria Magenta
Scarlet O'Hara
Henna ma honey
You are the one
Ma silver moon lady
She like a choir boy
Hair all a-cloudy
And flying and real

A halo of sky gold
A moon on the water
A scuddy go cloud go
Aroundy the sky bowl
Henna ma honey
You are the one

My copper go-go-girl
She like a show girl
Delightful Dolores
You are the one
My Anna Belinda
Rain on the window
Maggie yer reggae
You move me along

A halo of sky gold
The moon on the water
A scuddy go cloud go
Aroundy the sky bowl
Henna ma honey
You are the one

A halo of sky gold
Moon on the water
A scuddy go cloud go
Aroundy the sky bowl
Henna ma honey
You are the one
