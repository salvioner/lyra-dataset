I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa <i>(I bless the rains)</i>

I bless the rains down in Africa <i>(I bless the rains)</i>
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa <i>(I'm gonna take some time)</i>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh
er have
Ooh ooh
