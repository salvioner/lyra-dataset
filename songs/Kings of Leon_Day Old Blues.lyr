Toss me a breath when you hold me down
Hot like a razor on my face
Something's growing that don't help me now
Paging the doctor, just in case

Low and behold things are killing me
Silly expectation of a dream
Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair
Boys are gonna hate the way I seem

Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old

Peach Christmas lights spitting German ling
Feels like a fast or homeless sleep
At least there's a record that I love to play
Dreaming about a place I'll never see

Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues

Betty, Betty, Annie is a praying
Baby, with a man like a lung
Smell her crying fighting back a fever
Mad as hell give up

Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
