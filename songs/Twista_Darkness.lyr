You don't wanna bring darkness into this.
You don't wanna bring darkness into this!

Nigger got me fucked up,
Kicking on my horse like I wouldn't leave a nigger punch drunk
Went around talking all tuff chump 
Fuck around and get stuffed up 
Better believe if a nigga tred ninety fuck

Beat him up, cause a nigger tries his luck,
Beat him up, while a nigger try to duk
But when I line him up ill be fireing him up
Like two lines of dust
Im ganna be two glokes with it  im cock aim ready to pop with it
If the bullets gone rain get ready to drop mane nigga got dat fifty

And if a nigga thinking that im kiding 
I gotta slug, whith your name on it hommie you can come get it
And you give nigger the blame, cause you're the one that did it,
When niggers start shit they reconn a nigga wont finish 
Give him shots in the face, like a denis im a menace
I'm gonna make sure a mother fucker feel it.
Soon as a nigga get into my bussiness 
Only got a couple secounds till his blood start spilling
Fuck yowll figure recless and cold but a hole in one of yowll bitches
Half of yowll whoes the other half snitches matter of fact fuck it
All of yowll get it Leave no witness
Your fucking with the mother fucking realiest
Ill be fucking with them killers,killers

The niggers on the block with them glocks 
Steady running from the cops drug dealing 
He ill be thinking that his hard .
Till I hit him in his heart and his body fell apart like syphilis.
You dont want to swap bullets with the mob
You don't wanna bring darkness into this.
You don't wanna be around when the reaper comes,
You don't wanna be on the street where the nigger got beef
And a nigga got heat just run

You don't wanna get into it
With a nigga that straight black out
Nigga you really dont want to take that route
Fucking with a nigga that staright jump out
You don't wanna bring darkness into this!

Darkness into this!
Darkness into this!
Darkness into this!

Don't talk that shit now!

Automatic shots at the enemy while im screaming out bitch die
Shoulda woulda hooda let your fists fly
Did you think that you will die while you were this high?
Did you think the streets sweaper will make you look at the reaper 
Then take a peak at death and your soul when it got cold?

Did you think that you ever would take a good look at The God through a black whole?
See me hooded semi automatic when niggas thinking there hard to the fullest 
Im a pull it on the mob im a pull it 
I will put i slug in your chest  and watch you slide for the bullet
While choken on the blood
Try na get that money from me but i was quiker i caught him with a slug
And on his shoulder was some blood and im give no enemy some love
And i hope your boy is a thug

See if he charges ye,
See if his on mark
See if he got the heart to do what he gotta do.
Like he a G like he a G

You can forget about it!
Im off the chain like a fith of henacy
Or like a pimp be when he see 
A nigga try tip sweet
Let your lips speak, see the clip leak 
When inflect heat leave a mother fucker up shits creck

Pop one of the beats, kill one of the souls,
Murder one For that shit you should be ready to fight for
Got something might get shot twice for

Me and my garage is infamous.
You don't wanna spark the emphasis,
On a pistol that could make it pitch black in the room.
You don't wanna bring darkness into this.
You don't wanna be around when the reaper comes,
You don't wanna be on the street where the nigger got beef
And a nigga got heat just run

You don't wanna get into it
With a nigga that straight black out
Nigga you really dont want to take that route
Fucking with a nigga that staright jump out
You don't wanna bring darkness into this!

Darkness into this!
Darkness into this!
You don't wanna bring darkness into this!
