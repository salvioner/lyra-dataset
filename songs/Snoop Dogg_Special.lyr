{Brandy:}
It's the way you,
It's the way you make me feel

Baby just don't change, you're so real

Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
{Pharrell:}
Girl you know you are special
I bet you were born in the sky.
{Brandy:}
Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
{Pharrell:}
Girl, you know you are special, girl
The hottest in my mind


I know you, and you know me
And this is the place that you really wan' be
Let's make it crack-a-lack i make it look easy
Life can be a carnival and imma be your reason
Kiss me slowly,
Perform quiet storm til I get you nice-ly
I'm puttin out the blunt cuz I see
I see that I need you more in my life
Than I need a bag of weed.
Now I compare you to a bird
When she fly by
I wanna rock you back to sleep
Like beddy-bye-bye.
Bounce in the 'lac
With your hand on my leg
Throw your bags in the back
I'mma show you where it's at
No telling if we might come back
You like that?
I figgerd out a way to catch a flight right back
See I ain't never flown for fees
Come spend a weekend overseas in Greece with me
Please believe




You know, if you're through with me
Then I'm through with you
But you're the one who fell in love
And said that love was true

But you ain't never fake on me
And you think that you gon find
Another G like me?
Dem nigga's aint gon' play
They gon' just hump
They ain't gon do it yo way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true
And know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, Go to France
On a 3 day cruse
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,
It's our little rondez-vous
Whoopty-whoop
Big snoopy and ooh
I picture this love affair of ours
To last a lifetime just like flowers
Take a quick flick the get dressed
We'll head to Brazil,
I'll show you how it feel
When you're rollin' with the real
How it feel?




We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, dont go
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especial-ly
I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible
My ice cream, have a lick
I catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need
Come be my number one, please?
See I ain't never blow no cheese
And done no songs like these
I love the air that you breathe
