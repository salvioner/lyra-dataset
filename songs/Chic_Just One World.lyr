Everybody strut

Chic 
Chic 
Everybody strut

Come on everybody
Give me a C C

Give me an H H

Give me an I I

Give me a C C

If your friends are chic
Consider yourself unique
Just one favour we ask
We hope it's not too hard a task
If you don't mind, would you please
Get up off of your seat and repeat

Chic
