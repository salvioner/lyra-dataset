Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

Sometimes I wake up feel like I'm in Forest City, Arkansas
Although I'm free I'm still a prisoner of all our soul
Sometimes I lead it, roof in 4, you never ride down since
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I'm still in prison
I reach out far to meet her hand, I'm trippin cause she listen
It's pitch black dawg, like I'm in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former 3 ain't talk about me like I'm getting buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul, these devils got a hold
Did everything, you need to kill me, like you did to Joe
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my babysitters, he took my wife and kids
But he can't take nothing God can't give me back again

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that will again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I've risen from a better death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God's wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
I'm a king, I dare to lead when they just follow me
I see a better way, I'm keeping my eyes on the sparrow
I'm exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me fore she left this earth that I was special
Ever cause I'm special, they gon make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the 3rd day
Just save your head and get a favor, let the church say...

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Yes, He loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Oh
