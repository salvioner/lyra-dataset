If he walks by and the women get engrosed
If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast
He's got a lot of what they call the most

You know the boy can't help it
He was born to please
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it

If he mezmerizes each and every one
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twentyone

You know the boy can't help it
He was born to please
And if i got to go down to him on bended knees
It's because I'm hoping, obviously
That some day his answer will be
The boy can't help it
He's in love with me.
