Hey

They said no when I told them that
I find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the to worry about
When someone would mention me they always try to say I'm a flop
But this The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
Revenge.


Yeah, on the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
You can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
'Cause that's really the only person that can judge & critics people that wanna see you fail
And tell you what you can do, shouldn't do, must do
And when you got that glow
Nobody's else words can really bugs you.

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win

And when you get to the gates of heaven they probably wouldn't let you in.

But to change that meanin' of it success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what it should've could've or would it been
You turn you head towards the future & keep it movin'. You know what I'm sayin?
Well say it again.
Keep it movin'. You know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then.
You know what I'm sayin'?

If you waitin' for me to fail
Your time is runnin' out on the glock
I'm runnin' to the finish, yeah
When I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have
But now I tell them look what I got
This The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
The Sound Of Revenge
Revenge.
