Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid
Building Rhymes Like Buildings, Like A Stonehenge Druid
Step Up And Get Enlightened, Educating My Mind
I Play The Tape Forward, It's Not Time To Rewind

Step Inside The Mother Fucker And I Get My Flow On
Almalgamate my style so I got something to grow on
Season's Change When It Comes Their Time
Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime

Well, It's The King Ad Rock And That's Who I Am
Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam
'Cause I'm Thin And I Don't Grin 
But Check It Out People 'cause I Love To Go And Swim

Caught Up On The Phone Fiber Optic Distraction
Information Super Highway Got The Brain Contraction
I'm The Kung Fu Master Vs. The Sumo Wrestler
Got The Beats In Manhatten You Can Hear In Westchester

Well, My Mother Was Born Out In Coney Island
Raised On The L.E.S. Manhatten Island
My Dad Came Out From Detroit And They Had Me
And Back On Through Ellis Island Goes Through The Family Tree

Well, I'm A 6.7 On The Richter Scale
I've Got Rhymes galore and yo I Never Fail
Like Gravy On Potatos, Luke To Darth Vader
I'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later

You See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts
You Say "Yeah Mike D" And I Say "Mic deez Nuts"
I've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch Grab The Mic 'Cause You Know You're My fellow

Well When I Get It Into The Zone
I'm Gonna Take it To A Place Where It's All One
My Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking
My Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln

'Cause I'm The Fuckin' Rythm Ace With The Rhyme Selection
Listen All Y'all I'm rappin perfection
Because I Got The Mother Fuckin' Old School Flavor
That You Savor So Watch Your Behavior

Talking Other Dimensions, Levels Higher
Why Did Billy Joel Say "We Didn't Start The Fire"
Take You To Another Realm, Another Level
I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil

I Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime
Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind
Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind
And Every Wall That I Face Is Ow My Own Design

Yeah, Glendale Boulevard Boulevard
Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At
It's Where I'm At, Where I Live
Check It, check it Out Because My Head Is Like A Sieve
And We Turn It Out
