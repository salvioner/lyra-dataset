Sometimes
I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

So, if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive? Aah ah ooo

It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find
That when I drive myself my light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo-doo
Mm-bum-mm-bum, doo-doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo-doo
Mm-bum, bum, bum, bum
 doo-doo
Mm-bum, bum, bum, bum
