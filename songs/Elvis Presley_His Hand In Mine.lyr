I can feel his hand in mine and that's enough for me


He will guide each step I take
And if I fall I know he'll understand

I can feel his hand in mine
That's all I need to know


He will guide each step I take
And if I fall I know he'll understand

I can feel his hand in mine
That's all I need to know

I can feel his hand in mine
That's all I need to know
