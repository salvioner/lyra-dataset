If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself into your memory
As long as you were still alive

I would live inside of you
I'd make you wear me like a scar
And I would burn myself
Into your memory
And run through everything you are

I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide
I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide

I would live inside of you
I'd make you wear me like a scar
And I would burn myself
Into your memory
And run through everything you are

I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide
I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide

In the eye

If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself
Into your memory
As long as you were still alive

I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide
I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide

In the eye
In the eye
Look me in the eye
In the eye
In the eye
In the eye
