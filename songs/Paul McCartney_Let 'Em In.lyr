Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favor,
Open the door and let 'em in
 
Sister Suzie, brother John,
Martin Luther, Phil And Don,
Brother Michael, Auntie Gin,
Open the door let 'em in.
 
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favor,
Open the door and let 'em in.
