Want to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
Hust kinda stuck between my fantasy and what is real

I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I stop every day
Knowing that I won't

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even If I did I don't know If I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it

And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because of you

All because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gon get me some
Know I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even If I did I don't know If I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I am so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it

And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because of you
All because of you

And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Ain't no doubt
So strung out
Ain't no doubt
So strung out
Over you
Over you

Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I am so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it

And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because of you
All because of you

And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

She's the sweetest drug
