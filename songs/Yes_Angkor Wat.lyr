Out of the brightest tree the moon became the morning sun,
And there again reflected on the dreams of everyone
Out of the starlight night the telling of all our lives,
And racing faster than the Northwestern World

Starpoint to signal our endlessness
Starpoint to signal this evermore
Starpoint to compass: We look to the North
To return to the centre: Angkor Wat
