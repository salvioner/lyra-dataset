Baby girl, here she ain't no amateur 
Wears couture and smiles for the camera 
Hottest bags, got the neatest handler 
Yes, she is a freak, and when I'm out and taking trips, 
I mean there she goes up in my mix 
From Paris, Peru, to every club 
She be tearin it up, what. 
She is so sexy and I'm into her, into her 
Yeah, I'm into her, into her 
For sure. 

She go on like a circus, the way she works it, work it 
Straight up like a circus, the way she works it, work it. 
Baby, go and work it 

Do you like my body? 
Girl, you know I do 
Do you think that I'm a hottie? 
Girl, you know I do 
Do you wanna go and party? 
Girl, you know I do 
Well, whatcha wanna do? 
Here's what I wanna do 

I'mma give you some grown man 
I'mma give you some grown man

Baby, show me whatcha gonna do 

She's living the crazy life 
They don't stop until the midnight 
Don't need the sun; she's got the strobe light 
Workin in slow motion 
She stands on bars and pops on tables 
Showin her designer labels 
I ask her why she's so unstable 
She just don't give a, don't give up easy. 

She is so sexy and I'm into her, into her 
Yeah, I'm into her, into her 
For sure. 

She go on like a circus, the way she works it, work it 
Straight up like a circus, the way she works it, work it. 
Baby, go and work it 

Do you like my body? 
Girl, you know I do 
Do you think that I'm a hottie? 
Girl, you know I do 
Do you wanna go and party? 
Girl, you know I do 
Well, whatcha wanna do? 
Here's what I wanna do 

I'mma give you some grown man 
I'mma give you some grown man 
I'mma give you some grown man 

So you wanna get with me? 
I gotta say that's what's up 
But I must admit, I ain't easy 
You gonna be working overtime on me 
Tell me what you want 

I'mma give you some grown man 
I'mma give you some grown man 
I'mma give you some grown man
