I saw when arrived looking like a supermodel
You ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I like the way you .. put that thing on ..
So get, get get get up on the ..

I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that i am dinner you can be my song shake up
You ain't tryin to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker.

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa.

Sexy little mama ..nice to meet you
Can i be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If i bring up my camera will you be in my future
'cause we're gonna do some things
Hope your daddy ain't no preacher

I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that i am dinner you can be my song shake up
You ain't tryin to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker.

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa.

Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa.
