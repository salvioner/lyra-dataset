Take me back to California
To those crystal neon signs
Where the travelling sensations
Are all blinded by the light

There are eyes in every corner
Bloated brains and rotten smiles
There are coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky

Won't you come 'round my way
For some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way
It's a conversation piece

Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wake, ooh

I'd love to know just what you're thinking
Tell me what I ought to do
I will never leave you lonely
You're the one I'm running to

Get me out of California
Take me off into the blue
We can make it out together
To the place that's calling you

Won't you come 'round my way
For some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way
It's a conversation piece

Won't you come 'round my way
For some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way
For some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way
It's a conversation piece
