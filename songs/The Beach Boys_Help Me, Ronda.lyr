Well, since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head
I come in late at night
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed

Well, Rhonda, you look so fine <i>(Look so fine)</i>
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda

She was gonna be my wife
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it ruined our plans

Well, Rhonda, you caught my eye <i>(Caught my eye)</i>
And I give you lotsa reasons why
You gotta help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart
