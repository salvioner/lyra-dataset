Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky

Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up

Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

'Cause I'm gliding up there oh so very high
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then I'd fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here

I guess I'm just here for the ride
I swear, it feels like I'm dreaming
It's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want

Tie me to whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight
You know my name, so I run this town
When I'm on this mic, yeah

So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray
I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I float
Rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes

I don't mind, I've been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold
Trying to keep my toes unfroze

Now I'm in your house
Now I'm in your stove
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky

Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up

Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Yeah, by far much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute
That they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart

My soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel?
Then you can relate to this
I just blazed with this

Maybe roll one up then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay every day, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this

From the womb all the way to the grave, I spit
Show y'all niggas what greatness is
Yeah, I'm talking very Lucy like making movies
To picture my life boy

You need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in day
Then runaway at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class
I don't even write

Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky

Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up

Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
