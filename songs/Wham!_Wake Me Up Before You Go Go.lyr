You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky-high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain <i>(yeah, yeah)</i>
Goes bang-bang-bang till my feet do the same

But something's bugging me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me
What you did last night

You left me sleeping
In my bed
I was dreaming
But I should've been with you instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah yeah

You get the gray skies outta my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady
I'm your fool
It makes me crazy
When you act so cruel

Come on, baby
Let's not fight
We'll go dancing
Everything will be alright

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Cuddle up, baby
Move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night

It's cold out there
But it's warmer in bed
They can dance
We'll stay home instead

<i>(Jitterbug)</i>

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

Wake me up before you go-go
