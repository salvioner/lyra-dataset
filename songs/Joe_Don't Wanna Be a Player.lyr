Don't wanna be a player 
Don't wanna be a player 
Don't wanna be a player 
Don't wanna be a player 
Don't wanna be.. 

1 Don't wanna be a player no more 
I think I found someone I could live my life for 
Don't wanna be a player no more 
I think I found someone I could live my life for 
I'm yours your mine for sure 

I had enough of running wild 
I'm switching out my whole lifestyle 
I don't wanna live the way I used to 
I'm giving up the booty cause 
Spinning C's at the ta-ta bars 
No leaving with two or three girls to get me off 

2 - All I need is one who's really down 
Someone to turn this player's life around 
Girl I feel like you could be the one 
To make a difference in my life 
Cuz I'm tired of living tripe 

Repeat 1 

No rolling with an entourage 
Celeb' style like a movie star 
Sippin down with the ladies all around me 
Laughing girls off at the way I was of the morning 
Gettin' beeps from Milan and Delhi 
A true player never gets a chance to sleep, no 

Repeat 2 

Repeat 1 

Baby girl I'm buggin over you 
You got me giving up the things I used to do 
You got so much in life to gain 
And to prove to you I'm getting out the game 
No more players style 

Repeat 1 until fade
