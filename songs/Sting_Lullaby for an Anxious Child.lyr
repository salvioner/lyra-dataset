Hush child
Let your mommy sleep in to the night until we rise
Hush child
Let me soothe the shining tears that gather in your eyes

Hush child
I won't leave I'll stay with you to cross this Bridge of Sighs
Hush child
I can't help the look of accusation in your eyes
In your eyes

The world is broken now
All in sorrow
Wise men hang their heads

Hush child
Let your mommy sleep in to the night until we rise
Hush child
All the strength I'll need to fight, I'll find inside your eyes
In your eyes
