I get up every morning
I'm mean to everyone
But you just you ignore me
You seem think it's fun

And I need to get away
And you need to get away from me
And you see it's the right thing
And that is why you're right for me
And that is why you're right for me 

I watch the girly dancers
Passing one by one
I'll never really have to meet them
I have my dance and we're done

And I need to get away
And you need to get away from me
And you see it's the right thing
And that is why you're right for me 
And that is why you're right for me 

I've got a book of special pictures
I take a peek off and on
When I'm alone in the morning
I get my own thing going on

And I need to get away
And you need to get away from me
And you see it's the right thing
And that is why you're right for me

And I need to get away
And you need to get away from me
And you see it's the right thing
And that is why you're right for me
And that is why you're right for me
