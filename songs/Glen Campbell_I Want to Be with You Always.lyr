I lose my blues honey when I'm with you
No one else could ever do you're in my heart to stay
But when I'm gone and I'm all alone
I'll be singing this song I want to be with you always
I'd be happy dear if you could always be here and always be near forever and a day
For my love is true my love is only for you
I'll never be blue if I could be with you always if I could be with you always
