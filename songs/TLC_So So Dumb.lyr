Alright alright

Dumb dumb dumb
So so dumb so dumb
Dumb dumb dumb
So so dumb so dumb

Everytime I see ya
Simple bitch please
Come here and talk to me

Tell ya what's been on my mind
The wife's a friend of mine
Why do you need some
Georgia Pine in your life
Do you love everything
About the woman you with
Why you tryin' to get with T
I thought that you had
Responsibility


She folds all your clothes
Whatcha runnin' around for

I can't think that you're so
Dumb dumb dumb
She thinks you're so faithful
So so dumb so dumb
And she's such a pretty girl
Dumb dumb dumb
How could you be so damn
So so dumb so dumb

I can't believe
You're knockin'
You're knockin' at my door
I should get my gun
And gun you to the floor
But instead
I think I'll invite you in
I'ma call your wife boy
And let her know where you've been

Cuz she thinks that
You're so faithful

Ain't goin' down like that no more
Guess who's knockin' at the front door
Ain't nobody you wanna see come in
You should appreciate your girl
Stop tryin' to push it on me

I can't think that you're so
Dumb dumb dumb
She thinks you're so faithful
So so dumb so dumb
And she's such a pretty girl
Dumb dumb dumb
How could you be so damn
So so dumb so dumb

And one day love will leave your side
And no other will hear your cry
But you had to live your own life
Now nobody likes you
Not even you

Why you gotta be so
Dumb dumb dumb
You've never been faithful
So so dumb so dumb
And you can have those other girls
Dumb dumb dumb
Cuz I'm no longer in your world
So so dumb so dumb

I can't think that you're so
Dumb dumb dumb
She thinks you're so faithful
So so dumb so dumb
And she's such a pretty girl
Dumb dumb dumb
How could you be so damn
So so dumb so dumb


You better play her somewhere else

You need to find some help




So so dumb so dumb
Dumb dumb...
