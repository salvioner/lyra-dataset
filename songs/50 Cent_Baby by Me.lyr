Shawty said, "Take it off"
I take it off
Climb right out of my clothes
Want me to break you off?
I break you off
'Til your love come down on them walls

I'm extremely focused when I'm strokin'
I bet I'll get you open
I'll leave your headboard broken
You think I'm jokin'?
I bet I'll get you open

First it's her neck, yeah, then her back
Yeah, I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I perform for you, like a porno star
'Til you had enough then I just need a lil' bit more

New music, new move, new position
New erotic sounds is goin' down, now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, your sweatin'
I can paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper
I told you I'd get you

I'll work that, murk that, just the way you like it baby
Turn a quickie into an all-nighter, maybe
Your sex drive, it match my sex drive
Then we be movin' as fast as a NASCAR ride

Switch gears, slow down, go down, whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I use my tounge baby, I'll leave you sprung baby
I'll have your head spinnin' sayin, "50 so crazy"

Girl, I want you to gimme what you got, then gimme more
Baby, you can start on top, or all fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it

Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call it Hennessy thug
Passion, you laughin', I make you smile on a regular
Tell me what you want shawty, that's what I'mma get for you

I need you to give what I need, more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breath
I need you, I'm tellin' you so now you know what I need

I be your part-time or full-time lover, significant-other
No matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutter
Girl, you can get it however you want to get it
I'm feelin your style, I'm tellin' you right now, I'm with it
