Once I had a pretty girl
Her name it doesn't matter
She went away with another guy
Now he won't even look at her

Hats off to Larry
He broke your heart
Just like you broke mine 
When you said we must part
He told you lies, 
Now it's your turn to cry-cry-cry
Now that Larry's said goodbye to you

I know this may sound strange
I want you back, I think you'll change
But there's one more thing I got to say

Hats off to Larry
It may sound cruel
But you laughed at me 
When you said we were through
You told me lies, 
Now its your turn to cry-cry-cry
Now that Larry's said goodbye to you
