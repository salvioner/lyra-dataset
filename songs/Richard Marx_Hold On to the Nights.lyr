Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for a while
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now?
Do we break another rule? Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I'm wishing I could give you more

Oh
Hold on to the nights
