Not about to try 
Time to please no one 
The first at last begins 
You martyr, you child 

You should ask for more 
Tired of being your no one 
Fame can hurt the soul 
You martyr, you child 

Leave 

This is not for real 
Forever pleasing someone 
The first at last begins 
You martyr, you child 
You martyr, you child 

Leave
