When I'm down, I go into
the land of dreams built for two
It's a world of consolation
and there's no need of any conversation.

Oh, velvet heaven, high in the sky above
I think of you when I'm blue in love
blue in love

Come to me and I'll be your guide
The moon never fails tonight
We'll be only disturbed by
Some gently sounds out of the sky.
