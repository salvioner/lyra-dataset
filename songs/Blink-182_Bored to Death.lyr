There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh


I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down

I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown

But all my friends are daring me to come over

So I come over and over and over

So let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think

That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar

And we'll go over and over and over

And we'll go over and over and over

And we'll go over and over and over

And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh
