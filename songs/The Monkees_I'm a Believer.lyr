I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got

What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried, ah

Oh, love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
Oh, I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said, I'm a believer, yeah
Said, I'm a believer, yeah <i>(I'm a believer)</i>
Said, I'm a believer, yeah <i>(I'm a believer)</i>
