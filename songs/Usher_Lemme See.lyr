Usher, baby
I hear you, yeah
Rock with me

Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know
If you're ready

She says she wanna take her skirt off
Be my guest! 
I decide to take my shirt off
And show my chest!

And we been sipping on that Merlo
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit oh! 

You can say it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see

Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see

I've been anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me
Sex babe, education
Hands on when you're with me
Give your heart to me, yeah

She says she wanna take her skirt off
Be my guest! 
I decided to take my shirt off
And show my chest!

And we been sipping on that Merlo 
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit oh! 

You can say it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see

Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see


Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been ballin' all my life, Lamborghinis, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets but on G5's I'm talking fly

Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You wit' a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Treyvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted

She on my wanted poster, ciroc in my mimosa
I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shoppin' in Milan
The four fifty eight Ferrari I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb

The sex is so explosive her stuff is supersonic

Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl we the hottest
Rockin' the most ice, I said we the hottest


You can say it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see

Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see
