Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself
Though I wanted to be brave, it never helped.

No amount of love's enough to end the pain

Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong, 
but the anger that you feel goes on and on.
And it's not enough to know that I love you still
So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill

If you listen you can hear the angel's wings
Up above our heads so near they are hovering
Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart. 

When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.
