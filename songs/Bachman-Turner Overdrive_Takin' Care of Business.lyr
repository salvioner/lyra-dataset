They get up every mornin'
From the alarm clock's warnin'
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people pushin', people shovin'
And the girls who're tryin' to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothin' all day

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and workin' overtime
Work out

If it were easy as fishin'
You could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a second-hand guitar
Chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows

People see you havin' fun
Just a-lyin' in the sun
Tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid
And we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothin' all day

And we've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
We've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and workin' overtime

Whoo
All right, ow!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Take good care of my business
When I'm away, every day
Whoo!

They get up every mornin'
From the alarm clock's warnin'

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothin'all day

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and workin' overtime

Takin' care of business, whoo!
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, yeah
Takin' care of business

Takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
Takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business, and workin' overtime, whoo!

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business, whoo!

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
