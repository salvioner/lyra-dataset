It crawls on his back, won't ever let him be
Stares at the walls until the cinder blocks can breathe
His eyes have gone away, escaping over time
He rules a crowded nation inside his mind

He knows that night like his hand
He knows every move he made
Late shift, the bell that rang, a time card won't fade
10:05 his truck pulled home
10:05 he climbed his stair
About the time he was accused of being there

But I'm not the man
He goes free as I wait on the row
For the man to test the rope
He'll slip around my throat
And silence me

On the day he was tried
No witnesses testified
Nothing but evidence not hard to falsify
His own confession was a prosecutor's prize
Made up of fear of rage and of outright lies

But I'm not the man
He goes free as the candle vigil glows
As they burn my clothes
As the crowd cries "Hang him slow!"
And I feel my blood go cold
He goes free

Call out the KKK
They're wild after me
And with that frenzied look of half-demented zeal
They'd love to serve me up my final meal
Who'll read my final rite and hear my last appeal?
Who struck this devil's deal?
