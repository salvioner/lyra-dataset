Well, we know where we're going, but we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowing, but we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children, and we know what we want
And the future is certain, give us time to work it out

Yeah

We're on a road to nowhere, come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
Feeling okay this morning, and you know
We're on a road to paradise, here we go, here we go

We're on a ride to nowhere, come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
Maybe you'll wonder where you are, I don't care
Here is where time is on our side, take you there, take you there

We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha, whoo

There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do, but they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby, it's all right

There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Yeah, would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Darling, they can tell you what to do, oh God, they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby, it's all right

We're on a road to nowhere, hey
We're on a road to nowhere, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere
