Baby, I think it's time for us to do what we came to do 

Here...come closer to me...Imma make you feel so good tonight 

I'll do anything you say 

Baby, here we are lyin in my bed 
With the same thing goin through our heads 
You been wantin my body, I been wantin yo body 
So no more waiting baby 

Can you move just a little closer 
Come and get this sweet lovin you deserve 
Girl I'll be real gentle with it I promise 
To make your body cum like 3 or 4 times in a row 

If you believe in me tonight all your fantasies will come true, in this bedroom 
And you ain't gotta say nothin, cause tonight I can read your mind 
Cause you want me to go down and push the power button 

Chorus 
Can, I be your remote, touch me turn me on 
Make me sing a song now put me on slow 
Baby push enter, now fast forward 
Girl you got me programmed, under your control 

Somethin about the way you turn it over and poke it out 
Said it makes me wanna grab the remote and put that ass on pause 

Girl it don't make no sense the way you imitate that dog 
When you do it, how you do it, baby take it all 
Tonight I'll be your slave, I will do anything you say 
Girl push menu and check out the features 
Just let me put this adapter in you it will keep you charged up 
Girl, I'll keep goin till you press the stop button baby 
All I want is for you to be happy when I'm done 
So I can call you my lady 
Push, audio on now 
Push, gettin too loud now 
Push, so wild now 
Push the mute now 
For somebody hear us up in here 
So professional I'd swear this here was your career 
Don't have to say nothin, girl cause I can read your mind 
Cause you want me to go down and, push the power button baby 

Can, I be your remote, touch me turn me on 
Make me sing a song now put me on slow 
Baby push enter, now fast forward 
Girl you got me programmed, under your control 

Just try to imagine that I'm the panel, and you are in control 
Baby push the down arrow and I will go down low 
Come on taste these juices babe I wanna feel you up 
I'm gonna push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it 

If you get lost just push the guide 
and I will lead you to your destination 
all you have to do is trust me 
Cuz baby girl I know what your body's yearning for 
See here are the rules 
I'm your remote and I have to do what you push 
So let your fingers do the walkin' baby there ain't no more talkin 
And you aint gotta say nothin girl, cuz I can read your mind 
Cause you want me to go down and push the power button babe 

Can, I be your remote, touch me turn me on 
Make me sing a song now put me on slow 
Baby push enter, now fast forward 
Girl you got me programmed, under your control 

Can, I be your remote, touch me turn me on 
Make me sing a song now put me on slow 
Baby push enter, now fast forward 
Girl you got me programmed, under your control 

Can, I be your remote, touch me turn me on 
Make me sing a song now put me on slow 
Baby push enter, now fast forward 
Girl you got me programmed, under your control
