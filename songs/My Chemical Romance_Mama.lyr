Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to hell

Oh well now 
Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions
I'd hate to see you cry
Mama
We're all gonna die

And when we go don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
And when you go don't return to me, my love

Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies

Well Mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should have raised a baby girl
I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection
They can amputate at once
You should've been
I could have been a better son

And when we go don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go

She said, "You ain't no son of mine"
For what you've done they're gonna find 
A place for you and just you mind 
Your manners when you go
And when you go don't return to me my love

That's right

Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant 
Except for the smell
Mama, we all go to hell

2, 3, 4
Mama, Mama, Mama, ohhhh
Mama, Mama, Mama, ohhhh

And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song

But the shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all night long

We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame we fall
And if you can stay then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call

We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high for tomorrow we die
And return from the ashes you call
