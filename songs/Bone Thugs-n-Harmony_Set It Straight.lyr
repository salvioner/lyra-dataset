Bone Thugs-N-Harmony back in this motherfucker 



Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up 
And we're yet to be replaced 
Krayzie Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh 


And check my style 
And in your vein like a drug 
And I got niggas passed out on the floor 
They done overdosed on the thugs 
I done sold over 30 million records 
You niggas better check it before you get up and disrespect it 
And that weed for twenty-four seven nigga 
I never knew a nigga that can smoke a pound like me 
Or get down like me 
And they don't make them like me 
Thugs-N-Harmony nigga the name will never die 
No matter how mad these niggas is actin' 
We gon go platinum 
So back that shit up before we blast this bitch up 
Then you get the picture ol' fag ass nigga 
Playas is what you want 
Then come and get it fresh off the grill well done 
Hot and ready 
We don't give a fuck what you want with niggas and bitches 
You be fuckin' with this and you will fill that I'm hot and ready 
And you will know what I mean 
I'll be the thuggish ruggish nigga on the block 
With two glocks it don't stop 
I bust one time and muthafuckas call the cops on me 
Thug you don't know me 
So don't think y'all finna hold me 
Cause homie niggas don't know me 


Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up

Nigga hit it

Steady on money 
And going to get me some 
You fuckin' with a nigga that's number one 
Doin it just for fun and now look at him run 
On some dumb shit not the assassin 
Imma keep smashin' 
Stackin my chedda chedda 
Nobody can do it better 
Whatevea whatevea, ya then I'm going to turn killa 
Better be knowin how the game go 
In touch with the real nigga 
Nigga I'm the drama 
Bring it nothin' but tough shit 
You could put this on yo mama 
Nigga I'm gonna make you love this 
Me and DJ Heist shootin' dice in the back of the ally 
Finna jump back in the Caddy 
Man we won them beat the badly 


Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up 
and we're yet to be replaced 
Bizzy Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh 


Lock up the shit 
As quick as a nigga can lock up his bitch 
With a cock in is pit 
Bleedin' right after we cocked him up in his crib 
Rottin' in rich with a semi-automatic shotgun 
Get the poppin' away up in a flick 
Lookin' at the crowed all nerves and shit 
My nigga Los was hittin' banks and shit 
Set aside these little gangsta bitch 
Cop killa we dotta love the incog neta 
With as tasty as his mama as she chookin' in a casino 
Man incafino niggas is only out fo they self 
and expect the kids to help and set shit on the shelf 

Like grape juice and wealth 
I've been waitin' for you to start talkin' to somebody else 
And we thinkin' about god in this reputation 
Pussy Niggas who hatin' 
How the fuck is my relations 
I'm ready to get some pressure 
Self built ward my local niggas are stotin' 
Stakin' and makin' in dikie suits with the matchin' bandanas 
Dippin' around, dippin' around 
Can't nobody catch us 


Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up 
and we're yet to be replaced 
Wish Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh 


We came up Eazy died you think we was gon give up 
We still some raw 
Don't you deny you know we brought this game up 
From the DJ's to the VJ's 
From the niggas from the essay's 
You know we brung this game up 
Everybody knows Thugs-N-Harmony 
From the beginnin' these niggas was trippin' 
And wonder why I be flippin' 
Who gives a fuck why I moved out of the hood dippin' 
Cause these niggas don't know how to act 
Catch you slippin' and I'll react 
Nigga fuck what you heard 
Fuck with Bone 
That's a fact 
Step on anybody and be ready for this movement 
I've been a thug gon stay a thug 
I don't talk about it I do it 
Now let me explain when we came in this game 
We was young thugs oh-ah all this money nigga what 
Now how you blamin' a nigga with all this cash 
Young black heated with a attitude like kiss my ass 
We aplogise to all our fans with hands in the stands 
But fuck these niggas writin' in these magazine nigga man DAMN! 


Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up 
and we're yet to be replaced 
Bone Thugs they say uh uh oh uh uh oh
