The birds don't sing, 
They crush my skull, 
And I am worthless 
And the heights of what I stand up to are not in you. 
And I can't get no words 
With no feelings from nothing.

I don't know, 
Where you could ever go. 
1st voice chorus I wonder why, 
You bleach the sky 
You could not break These strings of mine 
I never knew, 
To walk back to A place that now belongs to you 
In body 
2nd voice chorus 
There I stand My earth 
Me here in body 
I stand my earth 
Me here in body 
A three point conversation in doors with 
No meaning when the world won't listen, 
Then you make your own way forward. Get out.

Not going to waste outside and I don't know where you could ever go.
I wonder why, you bleach the sky 
And could not break these strings of mine 
I never knew to walk back to a place 
That now belongs to you 
I wonder why you reach the sky 



There I stand My earth Me here in body 
I stand my earth Me here in body 
I stand my earth Me here in body 
I stand my earth Me here - nobody
