You push hard, you stop my circulation
I know you really need a physical relation
We may not be a perfect combination
You need your love, I need my mental stimulation
If I'm not there, defend my reputation
Well, that don't mean that there's a real negotiation
Take a longer look, this could be provincy invasion
What makes you think you've got that fascination?
I need space, oh, oh
Come back some other time and place
I need some more space
I need some
I know you're burnin' with anticipation
Hold on, here comes your education
Make sure it's love not just infatuation
Tell me why you always lead me to that destination
