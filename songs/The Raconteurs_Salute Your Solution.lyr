I seem to think I think I got a little situation
So listen to me, sister, listen, maybe you can help
I think I give a lot of problems my consideration
But not for me, they always seem to be for someone else

Why all the people always seem to just be on vacation?
What do I get from them? I don't get anything at all
I'm like a trash can holding all the information
And every single time I'm in the field to be taught

Salute your solution, now, salute your solution

I find myself just looking well beyond my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda prize I might receive at all
All others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all

And if there's one little answer to this complication
Someone, somewhere help me settle what is on my mind
There's only one I'm only taking, getting and receiving
There's only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one

And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite you

I find myself just looking worthy of my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda prize I might receive at all
And all the others seem to find myself a satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all

But if there's one little answer to this complication
Someone, somewhere some help me settle what is on my mind
There's only one I'm only taking, getting and receiving
There's only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one
