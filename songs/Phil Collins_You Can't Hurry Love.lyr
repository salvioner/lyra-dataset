I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes


No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
