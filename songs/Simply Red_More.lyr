You've had your flings
I've had mine
You've grown your wings
I've flown mine

The only way out is to
Give you more love
More of my love

Not a girl of my dreams
But two hearts and two minds
The strain that brings
Is ours until the end of time

The only way out is to
Give you more love
More of my love
