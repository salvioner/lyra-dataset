Please believe in me 
Though my love is hard to see 





So can I count on you to be my light to guide me 
Right through the night beside me 
Is it all right to count on you 

Smile away these blues 
I don't care if I'm accused 





To make me call on you to be my light to guide me 
Right through the night beside me 
Is it all right to call on you
