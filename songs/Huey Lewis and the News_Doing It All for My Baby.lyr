Early in the morning, I'm still in bed
She comes to me with sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses, "Hello sleepyhead."
Gets me moving in the right direction

I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Later in the evening, it's been a busy day
She lays her head upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing, snuggle up and say
Now I'm with you baby, the loneliness is over

I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it, doing it yeah
Doing it, doing it
Ooh ooh ooh


Doing it, doing it, doing it yeah

Ooh ooh ooh

Doing it all for my baby

Doing it all for my baby

Doing it all for my baby

Doing it all for my baby
