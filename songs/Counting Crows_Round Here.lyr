Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Well I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again, where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here, we always stand up straight
Round here, something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here, we're carving out our names
Round here, we all look the same
Round here, we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here, she's slipping though my hands

Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, it's only in my head
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here, she's always on my mind
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late

I... I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
