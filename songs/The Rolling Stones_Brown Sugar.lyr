Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver, know he's doing alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar
How come you taste so good?
Brown sugar
Just like a young girl should, uh huh

Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wondering where it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doing alright
You shoulda heard him just around midnight

Brown sugar
How come you taste so good, now?
Brown sugar
Just like a young girl should now, yeah

Ah, get along brown sugar
How come you taste so good, babe?
Ah, got me feelin' now, brown sugar
Just like a black girl should, yeah

Now, I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
I'm no schoolboy, but I know what I like
You shoulda heard me just around midnight

Brown sugar
How come you taste so good, babe?
Ah, brown sugar
Just like a young girl should, yeah

I said yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh
How come you, how come you taste so good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh
Just like a, just like a black girl should
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh
