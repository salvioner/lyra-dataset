If you really gotta know, I'm not doing so good.
Turned out to hurt more then I thought it would.

'Cos i just can't handle losing you again
but the last thing I want is to just be friends
we've been through the same thing time and time again

Let's pretend.

put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denial
let's pretend we're fine

If you really gotta know, I'm not doing so good.
It hurt me way more then I thought it could.

'Cos I just can't handle losing you again
but the last thing I want is to just be friends
we've been through the same thing time and time again

Let's pretend.

put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denial
let's pretend we're fine

lie to ourselves
lie to everyone else

take anymore of this make-believe romance 
is killing my make-believe mind

but i rather pretend we're together
then know we're apart

Let's pretend.

put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denile
let's pretend we're fine
