I can't, can't, can't say no
I can't, can't, can't say no
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no

It's a lot to say no
Interrupt the flow
When a guy wants to kiss
Who am I to resist?
Why should I be the one?
To miss out on the fun
Who am I to deny?
No willpower inside

Then I might, make fault tonight
Although I try, I don't know why

I can't, can't, can't say no
Everybody knows
I can't, can't, can't say no
Everytime it shows
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no

I'm afraid if I pass
I might end up last
On my glass of champagne
Who am I to complain?
When the chocolates are arrive?
I do more than just die
But there's nothing to lose
But should I refuse?

Then I might, make fault tonight
Although I try, I don't know why

I can't, can't, can't say no
Everybody knows
I can't, can't, can't say no
Everytime it shows
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no

Then I might, make fault tonight
Although I try, I don't know why
Then I might, make fault tonight
Although I try, I don't know why

I can't, can't, can't say no
Everybody knows
I can't, can't, can't say no
Everytime it shows
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no

I can't, can't, can't say no
Everybody knows
I can't, can't, can't say no
Everytime it shows
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no

I can't, can't, can't say no
Everybody knows
I can't, can't, can't say no
Everytime it shows
I would what I want, when I want
I can't say no
