From the album donovan

She walks through the stars
Past Saturn and Mars
Who knows how she feels
With the moon on her heel
She glides through the night
In Swirling soft flight
Owls hoot and stare
As the wind lifts her hair
She's my lady of the Stars
She's my lady of the Stars
She's my lady of the Stars
