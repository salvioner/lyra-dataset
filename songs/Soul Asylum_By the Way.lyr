If I could remember what makes me feel good
I'd pound it down like a nail in wood
I'd never let go of that feeling again I know

I know that I felt this way before
I'd pound it down like a cellar door
I want you to know I'm behind you, by the way

By the way that you look when I confront you
By the way that I affect the things you do
By the way did I tell you I can't leave you, by the way

I'll be waiting for you on judgement day
To watch all these judgements pass away
And by the way the details fall, by the way

By the way all the people that care about you
Are all watching to see what your gonna do
By the way have I told you I can't leave you, by the way

By the way that you built me up again
Back to a time when I was intense
And now I know you play for what you pay

By the way that you make me feel all right
By the way that you put up such a fight
By the way that my trust and faith is safe with you
