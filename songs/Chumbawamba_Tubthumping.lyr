We'll be singing
When we're winning
We'll be singing

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away
Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a vodka drink
He drinks a lager drink, he drinks a cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

O Danny boy, Danny boy
Danny boy

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away
Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a vodka drink
He drinks a lager drink, he drinks a cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

Don't cry for me, nextdoor neighbour

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down




You're never gonna keep me down
