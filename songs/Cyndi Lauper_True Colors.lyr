You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

<i>Can't remember when I last saw you laughing</i>

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are shining through

I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow
