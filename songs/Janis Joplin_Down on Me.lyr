Down on me, down on me, 
Looks like everybody in this whole round world 
They're down on me. 

Love in this world is so hard to find 
When you've got yours and I got mine. 
That's why it looks like everybody in this whole round world 
They're down on me. 

Saying they're down on me, down on me. 
Looks like everybody in this whole round world 
Down on me. 

When you see a hand that's held out toward you, 
Give it some love, some day it may be you. 
That's why it looks like everybody in this whole round world 
They're down on me, yeah. 

Lord, they're down on me, down on me, oh! 
Looks like everybody in this whole round world 
Is down on me. 

Believe in your brother, have faith in man, 
Help each other, honey, if you can 
Because it looks like everybody in this whole round world 
Is down on me. 

I'm saying down on me, oh, down on me, oh! 
It looks like everybody in this whole round world 
Down on me!!
