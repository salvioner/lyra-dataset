I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love

Them mistakes I will learn from them
Now you've changed, you were stern back them
Close the case, where's the lid
Rebuild the bridge that I burned down then
Back to an item all resurrected
Now we're back online, we're connected
Your older, I'm wiser, let's paint this picture perfect

I could have been anywhere by now,
But nowhere feels better than home
Yeah yeah yeah
If you don't know you should know right now
That you're the only that I want

Oh oh oh

I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh

Yo, if the vision ain't clear for now
Wipe my eyes, and I cleanse the mouth
Went from up to down to I nearly drowned
And now we're back around three sixty
And I missed you more than you miss me
It's a four letter word that my lips read
Now we're doing it faster in light speed

And the time is right so kiss me

I could have been anywhere by now,
But nowhere feels better than home
Yeah yeah yeah
If you don't know you should know right now
That you're the only that I want
Oh oh oh

I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love

They said the doors were closing in
Grab the towel throw them in
Let's try a second time, if it's wrong we fit the crime
Now the doors are opening, take my hand let's try again
Yeah, we're born to fight, welcome some soldiers in

I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
