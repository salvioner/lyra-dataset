I don't know if you'll understand
But I'm hopin' that you'll follow me down to the waterway
I'll be there if you change your mind
Listening to the ticking of the hands on a clock working overtime

If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl

Now you're here standing next to me
I've seen your face on every girl that I've held since you went away
It's getting late and I have to know
I'm mending the wings of a heart that was broken not so long ago

If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl

If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
