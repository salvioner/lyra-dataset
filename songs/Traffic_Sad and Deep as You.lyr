Lips that are as warm could be
Lips that speak too soon
Lips that tell a story
Sad and deep as you
Smile that's warm as summer sun
Smile that gets you through
Sad and deep you
Eyes that the windows
Eyes that are the dew
Eyes that tell a story
Sad and deep as you
Tears that are unspoken words
Tears that are the truth
Tears that tell a story
Sad and deep as you
