I've got a 'lectric guitar and half a bottle of warm beer
I've got some funny ideas about what sounds good
What sounds good
Better shut us down
Better shut us down

I've got a dollar fifteen and nothing better to do
I've got a half tank of gas and nowhere to go
Better shut us down
Better shut us down
Better shut us down
