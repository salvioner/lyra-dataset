She got the call
And then she threw her jacket on
And stormed off down the hall
They got the call
And picked him up at 4 a.m
And tore off down the road

And all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all to blame

She went alone
And went to the emergency
And parked her car in the dark
They told her please
He only has but minutes more
You might just say goodbye

'Cause all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all the same

And if you maybe figure it out
Would you still explain?
And if she said she was sorry now
Would you still complain?
And if you open up your heart
And stay so far away
But you are all the same
And if you maybe find a better way
To love me then
You are all to blame

'Cause all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say ooh, ooh
You are all to blame
