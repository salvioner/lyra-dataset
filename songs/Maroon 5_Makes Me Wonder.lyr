Wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what we're going through
I get behind, you make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
<i>(Oh no)</i> So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

'Cause I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
<i>(Oh no)</i> So this is goodbye

<i>(Oh no)</i> So this is goodbye
<i>(Oh no)</i> Yeah, so this is goodbye
<i>(Oh no)</i> Yeah, so this is goodbye
