I met a fan dancer
Down in Southside Birmingham
She was running from a fat man
Selling salvation in his hand

Now he's trying to save me
When I'm doing all right
The best that I can

Just another fallen angel 
Trying to get through the night

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

Coming over the airwaves
The man says I'm overdue
Sing along, send some money
Join the chosen few, hey

Mister, I'm not in a hurry
And I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing and climbing

Step by step, one by one
Step by step, rung by rung
Step by step
And step by step
Step by step
