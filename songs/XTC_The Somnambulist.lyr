Untie the gown, float to the ground 
She revolve round, making no sound 
Air leaving slow 
Still breathing though 

Decaying through brown, diving she's bound 
Hours swum down, treasure unfound 
Air leaving slow 
Still breathing though 

Somnambulist
Somnambulist
Somnambulist 
Somnambulist 
Air leaving slow 
Still breathing though
