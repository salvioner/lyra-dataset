Just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

I could say "day", and you'd say "night"
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame and that's all

I could leave but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time

Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time

I could leave but I won't go
Well it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you
More than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no-one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'till the end


Well I could leave but I won't go
It'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

But I love you
More than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend

There's been no-one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'till the end

But just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

I could say "day", and you'd say "night"
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame and that's all
That's all
