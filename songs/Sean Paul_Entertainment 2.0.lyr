I'mma hit the club, hit the weed
Hit the Gin then hit then drank
Poppin' bottle, buy the bar
Before I came through I had to hit the bank
Always toss a bitch or 2
You know, thats what trippy niggas do
30 goons in the V.I.P
Got you, pussy niggas spooked
Still hood, now I can buy the hood, my bitch bad, she fuck good
Mob around all through the town
I wish one of you hatin' niggas would
Life of a millionaire, on the way to be a billionaire
All I like is stripper poles and white hoes in their underwear

Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment



Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib


Bad man, live band, hair down my back nigga
Everything I do is dope, you would think I was a crack dealer
Big money, fast cars
Hoes all in my lap niggas
So far ahead the game
I might as well just lap niggas
Milk the game, lactose
She could see my chain from the back row
Came in with my niggas
Left out with some bad hoes
I got a black ho, a white ho
A Spanish ho and a Chinese
Yea they call me 2 Chainz and
My first chain's a Siamese
That's your favorite part
Whatcha gonna do for it
Hey girl she on the Molly

No horsin' around
Polo draws
She might say yes to me and no to y'all!

Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment



Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment

Ima hit the mix, with the chicks
Take my titts, I'm a hit the bitch
Hit the pole, hit the flips
Do it like Miguel, I hit the kicks
When I land, I hit the splits
Puffin on that trippy stick
Bitch I'm queen, 'Lizabeth
Bitch I'm bad, hissy fit
I'm a rip the skirt, hit the twerk
I don't give change nigga, hit the clerk
Drive niggas crazy, hit the skirt?
Ass on bounce, tits berserk
Life of a bad bitch
Nigga make my san'mich
Yes I been bustin' bands
All night, and I'm famished
He took the ass, we vanished
Pull up in the Aston Vanquish
I'm pickin' pockets, he finger poppin'
Now all my bitches in Paris

You bitches ain't fucking with me on my worst day
Fuck outta here

Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment



Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment

Girl roll it around and set it, set it
Bubble on down and pet it, pet it
Holding out the air, then get it, get it
I'mma take you home and bed it
Loving how fast you, set it off slow
Now whine it girl, and ready set go
All of dem treads, done shed it out now
Now rum pon da time, for eat it out now
Girl you my treat girl

From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
'Cause tonight I need some entertainment

From the car to the crib
