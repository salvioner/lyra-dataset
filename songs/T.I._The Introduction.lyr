I come apart babe, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin trouble sure, moving down the line
I come apart baby, but that's ok cause
Trouble man, don't get in my way

I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
Duffle back full of tools and a half brick
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress
Living on the edge jus a habit dawg
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all
Ball like a dog push it to the limit
Bout my business trynna keep from letting pussy niggas in it
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam,
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble trouble got in me
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man
Still the motherfuckin man you can call me, Trouble Man

Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man

Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man

Drugs n rock n roll, ho you know how I roll
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Frigerated console, the curtains on my car door
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado off-road
Also my flows I'm taking back although
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci Picasso
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes
Sorry Charlie party's over shorty shop closed
King home, bank roll on King Kong
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on
Prayin for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on
Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street
Make a U turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man

Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man

Weight on my shoulders chose to squat with it
Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it
Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is
Upset cause they can't do they thang like he did here
Shit, another year another deal done
No chump change big bank millions
Ya, my money old but I'm still young
Them nigga lookin for some drama I'm a give em some
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat
But cross a nigga path and your dead meat
Remain on my gang time, after time
'97 college bass head, 99 dime
'98 have provisions on 2-85 flyin
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed
Cut to the present and the rap game mine
Some things never change it remains I'm, Trouble Man

Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man
