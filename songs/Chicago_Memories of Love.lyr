A warm summer night
The moon above us
The stars for a wish come true
Are memories of love

A motionless pond
A beautiful swan
The smell of flowers growing near
Make me shed a tear

Memories of love gone by
Make me stop and cry
Now i kneel and pray
For the lord took her today

And all that's left to think of
Are memories of her love
