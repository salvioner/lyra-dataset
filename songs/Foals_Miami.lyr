I promised you open ocean glow
Mother of pearl, gold, and indigo
Cut through the waves, I watched you swim away
I'll never love you more than today

Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me

Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me


Now black light sets on my short day
Oh, you betrayed me, you gave it away
You don't mind picking up salt to rub into my wounds

Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me


Would you betray me
Or save me
Save me from you







Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me


Would you betray me
Or save me
Save me from you


Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me


Would you betray me
Save me
Save me
